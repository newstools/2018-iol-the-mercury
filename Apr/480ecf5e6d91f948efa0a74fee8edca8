Durban - The Recording Industry of South Africa (RiSA) has confirmed that two items have been struck off the nominees list for this year's installment of the South African Music Awards (SAMAS). They are; Tigi by Sands which was nominated in the Record of the Year category and Lake by the Ocean by Mobi Dixon which was up for Best Remix.
According to a statement released at the weekend, Sands is a citizen of eSwatini (formerly Swaziland) and as such is excluded from being considered for a SAMA in the Record of the Year category. Mobi Dixon’s Lake by the Ocean is a remix of an international song which is in contravention of the SAMA rules.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

"Tigi by Sands has been replaced by Love Me In The Dark by Sketchy Bongo featuring Kaien Cruz. Voting line is *120*2003*21#.  In the place of Lake by the Ocean by Mobi Dixon is Mwanagu by Jackie Queens and VeneiGrette remixed by Enoo Napa," the statement read. 

RiSA and SAMA are currently doing investigations into how these breaches were not picked up during the vetting process. After the investigation has been completed, appropriate remedial action will be taken.
