"Plastic pollution has truthfully always been around and at Greenpeace we have been trying very hard to highlight this over the years. I think this became more of a concerning issue after October 10, 2017 when [two] containers fell into Durban harbour carrying plastic polythethlene nurdles (resin pellets) - absolutely harmful to our precious marine life. The nurdles were eaten by fish and other marine mammals contaminating the food chain," said Greenpeace Durban volunteer, Johanne Pillay. 

The Durban branch of the organisation kicked off their restaurant campaign in March this year and are calling on restaurants to stop the use of single-use plastic.

"Kenya, Rwanda, Eritrea have all banned the use of single use plastic bags in their countries. Why can’t SA? So we starting with restaurants in Durban, asking them to stop the use of plastic bags, straws, plastic bottled water, plastic smoothie lids, plastic coffee cups and to switch to biodegradable [products]. It is possible as there are companies in SA that do sell biodegradable products," Pillay said.

"We are hosting a plastic pollution awareness event on Sunday morning at Ushaka Beach, near Moyo Pier. The event coincides with Earth Day - in the hope of bringing about change in Durban. We will be chatting with supporters and spectators about how we can break free from plastic and end plastic pollution together," said Pillay.

Did you know?
- Single use plastics, earbuds, wrappers, bottle caps, straws, takeaway coffee cup lids comprise the top 5 plastic pollutants found in our sea.

- Debris was sampled at 82 sandy beaches along the South African coast in 1994, 2005 and 2015. Man-made items collected from the sieved material included wood, wax, glass, metal, cigarette butts, rubber, metal and paper, but plastic items were by far the most abundant, comprising 99% of litter items.

- Several beaches consistently had thousands of plastic items per metre of beach.

- The highest concentrations occurred at beaches in the four main urban centres: Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, East London and Durban. 
- Together, these cities account for 63% of the roughly 15 million people who live in coastal municipalities, and are home to virtually all the plastic manufacturers, converters and recyclers situated along the coast.
