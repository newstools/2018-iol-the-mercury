Durban - The conviction and sentencing of a man, arrested for a murder at the Glebelands Hostel last year, has been hailed by the KwaZulu-Natal Acting Provincial Commissioner, Major General Bheki Langa.

He was responding to news that Khayelihle Mroza Mbuthuma, 28, had been handed down a life sentence after he shot and killed tuck shop owner, Sbongile Mtshali, at the hostel in July 2017. Mbuthuma and an accomplice had approached Mtshali, pretending to be customers. ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

According to police spokesperson, Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane,t he men opened fire, fatally wounding Mtshali before fleeing the crime scene on foot. 
"She sustained gunshot wounds to the head and chest  and was declared dead at the scene," Zwane said.

Mbuthuma was arrested during a raid in August last year. He was sentenced in the Durban Regional Court on Tuesday. 

Langa praised the team for their hard work and commitment in making sure the accused receive a deserving sentence. 

“We were blamed and not given enough time to thoroughly investigate these cases. Now our hard work yielded positive results and the sentence will serve as a warning to other criminals who terrorise hostel residents,” he said.
