This comes as a group of students attempted protested and attempted to disrupt classes demanding allocation and payout of NSFAS allowances. 

It bars all but the police from interfering with, threatening or even interacting with DUT employees, representatives or students while protesting. It also interdicts them from damaging the property of the university and compels the police to take all reasonable steps to give effect to the order. 

Alan Khan, spokesperson for the university said on Tuesday, that this protest was not sanctioned by the SRC which was working with the university to on the backlog of these allowances as agreed in a meeting last week.
