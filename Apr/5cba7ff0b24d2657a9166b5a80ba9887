Durban - The Police Committee is calling for the investigation into the riot at Moses Mabhida Stadium to be expedited. Francois Beukman, chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Police made the statement in Parliament on Tuesday after Chairperson of the Premier Soccer League, Dr Irvin Khoza, laid blame for the chaos on the shoulders of the police.

Beukman said the use of violence to highlight unhappiness remains a worrying trend in the country and requires societal introspection, as vandalism of infrastructure does not resolve anything.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

The committee also noted the arrests of 12 suspected rhino poachers in the Kruger National Park over the past five days. These arrests highlight the work accomplished by stakeholders to deal with rhino poaching.

“The committee is, however, concerned that among those arrested is a police officer based in Skukuza police station. This points to the presence of corrupt elements among the police, which undermines the rule of law they are mandated to uphold,” Beukman said.

The committee has called for lifestyle audits and vetting of all police officers near national parks in order to rid the police of corrupt elements.
