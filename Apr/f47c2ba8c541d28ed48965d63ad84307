Durban - Two children were killed after being hit by a minibus taxi in Newlands on Thursday. 

The children, aged 6 and 11, were on their way to school at the time. 

Emergency Medical Services spokesperson, Robert Mckenzie, said when paramedics arrived at the scene they found that both children had sustained fatal injuries. 

“They were declared deceased at the scene. Police were at the scene and will be investigating further. We send our condolences to the families of both children,” Mckenzie said. 

Meanwhile, video footage has emerged from a crash that claimed a life on the N3, near Shongweni earlier this week. In the video, which has been widely shared on social media, a Nissan X Trail is seen veering off the road, over the centre median and into oncoming traffic in the opposite direction.

Rescue Care Operations Director, Garrith Jamieson, said when emergency teams arrived at the scene, they found absolute carnage. 

“Two vehicles and a truck had collided before one overturned coming to rest on its roof. One driver had sustained major injuries and unfortunately there was nothing more paramedics could do for him and he was declared deceased on the scene,” Jamieson said. 

He said the second driver had sustained moderate injuries and was stabilised on the scene by Advanced Life Support paramedics before being transported to a nearby Hospital for the further care that he required.
