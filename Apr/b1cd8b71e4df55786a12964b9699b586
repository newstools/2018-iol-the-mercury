Durban - A traditional bash welcoming former president Jacob Zuma back to his ­Nkandla homestead has been cancelled after organisers discovered fraudsters using the event to solicit money from unsuspecting members of the public.
The Zuma family had planned for the party to take place on Saturday for the village of KwaNxamalala.

However, Zuma’s nephew, Inkosi Simphiwe Zuma, said the family had to cancel the bash after they discovered that there were people who had ­approached businesses claiming to be fund-raising for the function, but had instead pocketed the money.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

“We have cancelled the event because some people are taking advantage of it to ­enrich themselves.

“The AmaNxamalala village committee, which organised the function, is investigating the matter to establish who the culprit was,” said Sim­phiwe.

He added that the preparations had been running smoothly, but the party had been “spoilt by these crooks”.

“These are criminals who have nothing to do with us. They have been going around claiming to be representing the AmaNxamalala clan,” he said.

He said the matter had not been reported to the police, and that the event had been ­rescheduled to next month.

Ever since Zuma resigned as state president, the ANC in KwaZulu-Natal and his village community members had talked of organising a big welcome-back bash for him. 

Locals said they hoped that since he was now free from his previously busy government schedule he would spend time with them, and even participate in community development projects.

However, Zuma has been busy with the ANC’s campaign activities for the next year’s general elections. 

He has also been preoccupied with legal matters at the Durban High Court, where he will be appearing for his corruption, money laundering and racketeering case in connection with the controversial arms deal.
