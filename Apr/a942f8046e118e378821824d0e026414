Durban - Negotiations are set to start over ongoing disruptions at a multi-million rand Oceans uMhlanga construction site in uMhlanga, north of Durban
On Monday morning construction was halted for a second time after hundreds of members of the Delangokubona Business Forum arrived at the site and forced workers to down tools. 

By 11am, most of the members had left the site after an agreement to start negotiations with the developer was reached. The site was abandoned and no injuries were reported. ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

Monday's incident comes a few days after members of the forum arrived at the site and chased workers off. The project is being developed by prominent KwaZulu-Natal businessman and founder and chairman of Edison Power, Vivian Reddy.

Following the disruption last week, Reddy filed an urgent interdict against Federation For Radical Economic Transformation and its affiliates, including DBF, to prohibit them from causing disruptions at the building site. This further included their interference at other construction sites around the city.
