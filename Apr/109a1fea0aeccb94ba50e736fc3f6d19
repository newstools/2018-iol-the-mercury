Police spokesperson, Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane, said the incident happened in Birdswood. 

"The woman was on her way home from the local tuck shop when the suspect came out from the bushes and threatened her with a knife. He demanded money and the woman's cell phone. She told him that she did not have it and he stabbed her and threaten to kill her before raping her. After the incident the woman managed to run away and fortunately she came across a man who helped her and took her to the police station," Zwane said. 

A case of rape was opened and the docket was transferred to Empangeni Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit for further investigation. After an intensive investigation the accused was then apprehended. 

Zwane said Mdakane made several court appearance until he was convicted and sentenced. 

"He was sentenced to ten years for rape and five years for attempted murder. Sentences will not run concurrently," Zwane said.

 
KwaZulu-Natal Acting Provincial Commissioner, Major General Bheki Langa, commended detectives for their excellent investigation that led to the conviction of the accused. 

“We don’t have any space for rapist in our communities and we will make sure that those who are terrorising our women and children are brought to book. Women and children must break the silence and report any abuse to their nearest police stations,” he said.
