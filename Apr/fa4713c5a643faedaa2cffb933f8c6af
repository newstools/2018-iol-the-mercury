"There was a structure collapse at a building site in Oceanview on the Bluff. Upon arrival, we found that two workers sustained injuries. One of the men was trapped underneath the structure. The eThekwini Fire Department officials worked to free the man whilst Advanced Life paramedics were treating him. The second person sustained only minor injuries and was treated at the scene," he said. 

This incident comes just weeks after three people were killed when large concrete slabs, 11 metres high and weighing 14 tons, collapsed on to workers and a truck in Chamberlain Road.

Emergency response teams, including eThekwini Fire and SAPS Search and Rescue Unit using sniffer dogs worked for several hours to remove the bodies of the deceased workers.
