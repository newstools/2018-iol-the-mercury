He said the IPSS Medical Rescue  air ambulance, operated by Black Eagle aviation, was activated to fly the girl to Addington Hospital. 

Earlier in the day, a 53-year-old man was killed after crashing into a cow on the R102, near the King Shaka International Airport on Saturday. The man’s wife and a third person was also injured in the crash. 

Herbst said the collision took place on the south bound lane of the R102 between the Canelands and the airport intersection.

“The driver sustained fatal  injuries and was declared dead on scene by IPSS paramedics, while his wife and second passenger sustained moderate injuries,” he said. 

It is alleged that the driver of the bakkie was on the way to do a delivery when the driver knocked into the cow. The bakkie veered from the south bound lane across the northbound lane before crashing into an embankment. 

The cow was also killed.
