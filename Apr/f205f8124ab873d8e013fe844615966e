Although police confirmed to The Mercury that two people were arrested, Jojisa appeared alone in the dock. Police have not yet commented as to who the second person is or why they did not appear in court.

 



His cousin, Nhlanhla Gwija said Jojisa is not even a Chiefs supporter. 

Gwija claimed that Jojisa was trying to escape from the trouble when he was arrested. 

"He had gotten onto the field trying to escape the violence and not to cause any," Gwija said.
Jojisa's sister, Nontethelelo Jojisa, told The Mercury that her brother is an Orlando Pirates fan. 
"The State must find the real culprits. My brother had nothing to do with the violence," she said.

Jojisa is due back in court next week. He will be detained at the Durban Central SAPS holding cells until then.
