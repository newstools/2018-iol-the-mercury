About 200 people, said to be members of the veterans league, camped outside City Hall earlier in the day to protest. 

“I wasn't there when the clashes started but I understand the police Inyala was trying to get inside the City Hall yard and it drove over the foot of one of the soldiers.  I am not sure why it wanted to get to city hall. Even when it left it did not exit the same entrance it came in,” said one the leaders, who decline to be named.

"After the soldier was injured, the people were angry and there were minor disturbances. There were stun grenades fired, but the situation was quickly brought under control and the talks resumed again, he said. 

The MKMVA has threatened chaos if eThekwini Municipality fails to honor its promise to provide them with jobs, housing and business opportunities. It said there is a standing agreement that 10% of opportunities in the municipality would be set aside to benefit the military veterans.  

Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbhele confirmed that a man had been injured during the protest. 
“A case of public violence was opened at Durban Central police station for investigation and no arrests reported," she said.
