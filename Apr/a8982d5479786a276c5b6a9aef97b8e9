Icasa said that it stayed away from pricing issues because the regulation of prices requires more detailed market analysis. 
Users will know at a later stage whether data prices will be cut. 

The first regulation that was introduced was Usage notification, which requires all service providers to now send a notification when the usage of Data is at 50%.

Service providers are now required to provide an option to roll over unused data. This will ensure consumers don’t lose unused data.

The third regulation focuses on the Transfer of data. Icasa ruled that all networks must allow this option to be available to consumers.

The fourth regulation is base on Out of Bundle Rates. All service providers will no longer be allowed to charge consumers out of bundle rates when data has run out. 

Additionally, Icasa added that service providers must present subscribers with the option to buy a new bundle, or agree to out-of-bundle billing.

Counselor Botlenyana Mokhele, that led the proceedings said that consumers must be updated about data depletion at 80%, 90% and 100%.

Icasa stressed that these new regulations will block operators from charging out-of-bundle (OOB) tariffs without subscriber consent.
