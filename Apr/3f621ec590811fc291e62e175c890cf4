Durban - More than 100 buses from all over the province are expected to transport supporters of former president Jacob Zuma to Durban when he appears in court on Friday.

One of the Zuma support campaign leaders Bishop Vusi Dube of the eThekwini Community Church said the buses would start dropping off supporters at King Dinuzulu Park from tomorrow evening.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

Zuma is expected to appear at the Durban High Court on Friday where he will face 16 charges of corruption, money laundering and racketeering in connection with the controversial arms deal.

Dube said the march had been authorised by the eThekwini Municipality.

“We have had joint operations meetings with the SAPS, Metro police, NPA and court officials. We are going to have our last meeting on Thursday.

“The area in front of the high court is going to be cordoned off at 7 am.

Bishop Timothy Ngcobo said spirits were high.

“They are still regions who are reporting that they are coming down to support Msholozi (Zuma),” said Ngcobo.

Ngcobo said there would also be minibus taxis coming from other provinces with loads of Zuma supporters.

Part of the city is expected to come to halt as many streets might be not accessible to motorists, he said.

The theme of the gathering, which will be taking place at Albert Park followed by the march to the Durban High Court, will be ‘Hands off Zuma’.
