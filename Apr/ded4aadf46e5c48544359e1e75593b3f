According to Mazzone, Mahumapelo’s son is currently studying at a Port Alfred aviation school which do not form part of Denel’s list of accredited schools. Furthermore, she said Denel bursaries have generally only covered the fields of IT, engineering, finances, and business management.

She said this seems to point towards a breach of Section 50 of the PMFA - which reads that the accounting authority may not “(b) use the position or privileges … for personal gain or to improperly benefit another person” and Section 51 states that the accounting authority must “take effective and appropriate steps to … prevent expenditure not complying with the operational policies of the public entity.”

"It is now time for Supra and Ntshepe to face the music. We urge the police to investigate these charges and ensure that the truth comes to light. If there was any wrongdoing on the part of Supra and Ntshepe, they must be held accountable. Section 86 of the PMFA states that in the event the accounting officer is found guilty of an offence, they are liable to a fine or possible imprisonment," Mazzone said. 
Meanwhile, Denel has denied any wrongdoing on their part.
