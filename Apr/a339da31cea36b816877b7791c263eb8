Durban - Portions of the North Beach, Diary Beach, Country Club and Battery Beach will be closed for the next four weeks as the city’s Engineering Unit’s Coastal, Stormwater and Catchment Management (CSCM) Department will allow for sand pumping operations. During this operation, bathing and beach use will not be allowed in the closed off areas.

According to Coastal, Stormwater and Catchment Deputy Head, Randeer Kasserchun, the city prides itself with the maintenance of the beaches and it is important that they are nourished.

“There is a current severe shortage of sand on the beaches that will be closed for sand replenishment. If sand is not pumped onto the identified beaches, they may have to be closed for bathing as the safety of bathers will be at risk,” he said. 

Kasserchun said beach replenishment at these locations will be undertaken through an off shore system. Sand and water samples will be taken to test for water and sand quality. 

“This emergency sand replenishment process is a joint operation between the city and Transnet has been approved by the KwaZulu-Natal Department of Economic Development, Tourism and Environmental Affairs,” he said. 

Beachgoers are urged to be patient during this process and to comply with restrictions which have been temporally prescribed.
