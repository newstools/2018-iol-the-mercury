Durban - The Department of Education’s headache over the supply of sanitary towels to schools is growing amid allegations that the sanitary towels do not even meet quality assurance standards.

The allegations surfaced at media briefing, hosted by the National Teachers Union (Natu) at the weekend. According to the union, the sanitary towels had not been certified by the South african bureau of standards (SABS).ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

KZN Education MEC, Mthandeni Dlungwane, recently announced that the department would be launching an investigation into the distribution of sanitary towels to schools, following reports there had been an oversupply.

Natu Deputy President, Allen Thompson, said it was reported that school principals were complaining about the oversupply that was taking up space in classrooms and school libraries. Some principals said the sanitary towels were even being handed out to pupils in lower grades, including Grades R and 1. 

“It has now transpired that many of these sanitary towels oversupplied to the school have not been endorsed or certified by the SABS or any of its official agencies – as required in terms of the Standards Act,” Thompson said. 

Commenting on the matter, the department’s Kwazi Mthethwa said they have noted the allegations levelled against them by Natu. 

“We will respond comprehensively once we have studied their allegations. We further reiterate that as a Department of Education we believe in good governance and transparency,” he said.
