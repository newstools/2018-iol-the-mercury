“The woman, in her 80s, was stabilised at the scene and the IPSS Medical Rescue’s Black Eagle medical chopper was called out to transport the woman to a local hospital for the further care that she requires," he said. 

Earlier in the day, traffic along the N3, Durban-bound was backed up following a truck crash. 

Jamieson said a truck was travelling towards Pietermaritzburg when it crashed through a barrier and landed on the Durban-bound carriageway. 

"No other vehicles were involved. One person was treated for minor injuries sustained," he said.
