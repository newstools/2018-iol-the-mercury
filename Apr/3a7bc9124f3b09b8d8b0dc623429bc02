Durban - It was a busy weekend for volunteers from the National Sea Rescue Institute who responded to several incidents throughout the country. In one of the rescues, on Saturday, the NSRI Shelly Beach duty crew were activated following reports from NSRI Port Edward of a vessel taking water off-shore North of the Impenjati Nature Reserve.

National Sea Rescue Institute spokesperson, Craig Lambinon, said the NSRI Shelly Beach sea rescue craft, Spirit of Dawn, was launched and NSRI Port Edward dispatched a mobile rescue vehicle to assist with communications.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

“On arrival on the scene we found a 5.5 metre rigid inflatable rubber-duck (RIB) with crew onboard and the RIB had motor problems complicated by a pontoon separated from the hull. A tow-line was rigged and we towed the boat without incident to Shelly Beach where the casualty craft was recovered without incident,” he said. 

The day before, a hiker had to be airlifted to hospital after she hurt her ankles during a hike at Port St Johns. The woman reportedly hurt both her ankles and suffered a suspected fracture on her leg after she slipped and fell whilst out with a group of hikers. 

Lambinon said the NSRI rescue vehicle travelled some 14 kilometres from Port St Johns to where the woman was. 

“On arrival at the scene, medical attention was provided using our NSRI medical equipment.

Considering the difficult terrain and the inaccessibility of the area, the NSRI sought the assistance of the SA Air Force Oryx helicopter,” he said. 

Lambinon said the chopper landed on a beach nearby. 

“A National Defence Force doctor assisted the NSRI in stabilising the patient. She was then airlifted to Port St Johns and rushed to hospital in a stable condition,” he said.
