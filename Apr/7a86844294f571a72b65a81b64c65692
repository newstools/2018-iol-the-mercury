Durban - Convicted racist, Vicki Momberg, made a brief appearance in the Randburg Magistrate's Court on Wednesday. Wearing metal chains around her ankles, the 49-year-old former estate agent looked on as her legal team made presentations on her behalf.

Momberg is appealing against her two year prison sentence. After her lawyers had presented their case, Â the State was unhappy with the submission. The matter was postponed and her lawyers were asked to supplement their application. ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

Momberg was sentenced to two years imprisonment, on four counts of crimen injuria. 

During her appearance last week, Momberg came under immense criticism for her cornrows hairstyle. This week, Momberg had a French plait.

In 2016, a video of Momberg swearing at black police officers, went viral. In the video, Momberg used the K-word a staggering 48 times, verbally attacking the officers who came to assist her after her car was broken into.

She is due back in court next week.
