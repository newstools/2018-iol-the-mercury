Durban - KwaZulu-Natal Health MEC, Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo, officially unveiled 15 brand new machines that will significantly reduce treatment waiting times for cervical cancer patients. The launch took place at the Inkosi Albert Luthuli Central Hospital on Wednesday.  
According to the department, one of the most effective procedures to prevent cancer of the cervix occurring in women, who have been identified as being at high risk, is the Large Loop Excision of the Transformation Zone of the cervix (LLETZ) procedure. The function of the LLETZ machine is to conduct a small surgical procedure on the woman’s cervix.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

Using electrical current, the LLETZ procedure removes that part of the cervix where the cells are becoming abnormal - dysplastic - which might otherwise develop into cancer. These abnormal cells can be detected by a pap smear, which must be done regularly. An important feature of cancer of the cervix is that the disease has a long pre-cancer phase which lasts for several years. This provides an opportunity to detect it by Pap smear and then to treat it with the LLETZ procedure before it progresses to cancer. Unlike many cancers, cancer of the cervix is preventable.

The machines will be distributed to hospitals around the province.
