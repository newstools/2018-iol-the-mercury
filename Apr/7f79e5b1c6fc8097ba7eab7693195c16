Durban - In celebration of conductor Russell Scott’s 10th anniversary at the helm of the Durban City Orchestra, on Sunday, the orchestra proudly presents Romantic Legends, the first concert in the Masters Series - a series of performances dedicated to growth, expansion and success of the orchestra under Scott’s tenure. It returns to the Mariann-hill Monastery Church, with it’s wonderful acoustics and beautiful setting playing host to a programme featuring  three very different, but equally enthralling, Romantic masters.
Opening the concert is Schubert’s enigmatic Unfinished Symphony No 8. Left incomplete upon the composers’ death, the symphony’s lyrical melodies and dramatic structure provides the perfect concert appetiser.

The featured soloist for this concert is  KZN’s own Aristide du Plessis - co-principal cellist of the KZN Philharmonic.  Du Plessis has studied in Cape Town as well as at the Zürich University of the Arts, where he studied with the renowned pedagogue and principal cellist of the Tonhalle Orchestra, Thomas Grossenbacher.

Du Plessis joins the orchestra in Dvorak’s iconic Cello Concerto in B minor. A mini-symphony in itself, the B Minor Concerto, among cello concertos, has been called “supreme”, “the greatest” and the “king”. 

After the interval, the final work on the programme is the lesser-heard Symphonic Dances, Op 64 by Edvard Grieg. Well-known for his use and development of Norwegian folk 
music, his compositions put the music of Norway in the international spectrum.  

A collection of four folk songs drawn from an 1853 collection by Ludvig Mathias Lindemann, this exciting setting exploits the myriad sound and effects the romantic orchestra can create and brings the performance to an explosive close.  The concert starts at 2.30pm on Sunday.

Tickets are R100 (R80 pensioners and students) from quicket.co.za or at the door.- Lifestyle Reporter
