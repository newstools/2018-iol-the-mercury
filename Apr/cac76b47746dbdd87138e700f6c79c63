Durban - Police are investigating the circumstances that led up to a building fire in the Durban Central Business District at the weekend. The building is situated at the corners of Dr Pixley kaSeme (West) and Joseph Nduli (Russell) streets.
Rescue Care's Garrith Jamieson said the surrounding streets had to be closed to traffic while multiple fire teams tackled the blaze. Jamieson added that no injuries were reported. The fire broke out just after 11pm. 
It is unclear what started the fire. Earlier in the week, a fire ripped through the Lonsdale Hotel in Dr Pixley kaSeme Street. Here too, Jamieson said no injuries were reported. 
Meanwhile, in Pietermaritzburg, police are investigating a case of arson after a family of four died in a house blaze in the early hours of the morning. On Friday, Aziz Manjra, his wife Gori Bee, their son Rizwan, daughter Mehranisa and an elderly woman, were asleep when a petrol bomb was allegedly thrown into their Larch Road home. The family had just moved into the house two weeks prior to the blaze. 
No arrests have been made.
