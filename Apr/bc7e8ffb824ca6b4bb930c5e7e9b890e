Durban - Police are investigating an armed robbery following a shooting at a shopping outlet in Verulam on Thursday afternoon. It is alleged that armed men entered the shop and robbed a victim of cash. 

Reaction Unit SA spokesperson, Prem Balram, said a gang of four men arrived in a white VW Golf 6 and followed a man from the nearby bank into the store. 

“Shortly after the victim entered the prayer shop one suspect followed him in and robbed him of R 8000 which he had withdrawn minutes earlier. As the suspect exited the store he fired shots before fleeing in their getaway vehicle,” Balram said.

No one was injured in the shooting. An extensive search was conducted for the suspects however no arrests were made.

In a separate incident in Forest Hills, a family was held up while armed men stormed their home on Wednesday night. 

Blue Security’s Andreas Mathios said a resident had walked out of her Margaret Crescent home to close the door of the car when she was ambushed by three men. 

“She was at home with her husband and two children who were not harmed during the incident. The men forced her back into the house and asked her who else was at home. They ordered her not to scream and left her in the kitchen as they went into the house,” Mathios said.

He said the woman’s husband had already heard her screaming and came down the passage where the men grabbed him and held him up at gunpoint. 

They forced him to lie on the floor and ordered him not to look at them. They asked the resident for his car keys, safe and firearm but the resident told them that he doesn’t have a firearm and that his car keys were at the office. The gang then tied up the couple and ransacked the house,” Mathios said

The gang took three cellphones, tablets, laptops, hard drives, jewellery and vehicle keys. A neighbour disturbed the gang and they fled leaving behind the television and an empty jewellery box.
