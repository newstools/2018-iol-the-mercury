Durban - The KwaZulu-Natal Department of Health has become the first to offer needle kidney stone surgery at government facilities. 

The procedure, called mini percutaneous nephrolithotomy, was successfully performed on three patients at the Inkosi Albert Luthuli Central Hospital (IALCH) last month.  ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

Dr Ehab Goad, head of the urology department at the hospital said on Wednesday, that this technique had only recently been introduced at private hospitals, yet IALCH- a state facility- was already offering it. 

Removing kidney stones this way, minimises the risk of complication associated with open surgery. These include infection, excessive bleeding, the patient suffering side effects of anesthesia and in extreme situations, loss of the kidney. “In open surgery, a big hole in the kidney is almost like stabbing the kidney with a screwdriver, it is traumatic and very invasive.  With the new technique we are able to access the kidney through a small hole in the skin and break the stone,” said Goad. 

The scars from the surgery are barely visible and recovery time as short as a day or two, minimising costs and making it possible for more patients to be treated. 

“Nowadays we see more patients with stones, especially in the African population. I did a study in 1998-1999 and between 1995 and 1999, we saw only two or three stones in the African population. Now we see two or three African patients with stones every day.” Goad said this was related to diet and prevention, such lots of drinking water, avoiding processed food, excessive salt and meat, were key. 

Health MEC Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo congratulated Goad and his team for successfully performing the groundbreaking surgery.
