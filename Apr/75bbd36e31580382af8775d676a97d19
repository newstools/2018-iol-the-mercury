HOUSTON: A private funeral for former US first lady Barbara Bush, the only woman to see her husband and son both sworn in as presidents, will be held on Saturday at a Houston church where her family have been members since the 1950s, officials said.
Bush, wife of the 41st president George HW Bush, and mother of the 43rd, George W Bush, died on Tuesday at the age of 92. 

After the funeral at St Martin’s Episcopal Church in Houston, Bush will be buried on Saturday on the grounds of the George HW Bush Library and Museum at Texas A&M University in College Station, about 160km away, the university said. ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

She will be buried beside her daughter, Robin, who died at the age of 3 after battling leukaemia, the university said. 

First lady Melania Trump will attend the funeral, her office said. 

On Friday, Bush will lay in repose at St Martin’s, which will be open to members of the public wishing to pay their respects. 

Reverend Russ Levinson, senior pastor at St Martin’s, said that the church had about 250 members when the Bushes began attending services there, and would often serve coffee on Sunday mornings. 

“Both of them taught in our Sunday school program. Both of them have been involved in our outreach ministries,” he said. The church has grown to about 9300 members to become the largest Episcopal church in North America, according to its website. 

The Bush family had said in a statement on Sunday that she was in failing health and would not seek further medical treatment. 

According to some news media reports, Bush had been battling chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and congestive heart problems in recent years. 

The only other woman to be both wife and mother of US presidents was Abigail Adams, the first lady from 1797 to 1801. 

She was a major influence on husband John Adams, the nation’s second president, but died before son John Quincy Adams was elected president in 1824. - Reuters
