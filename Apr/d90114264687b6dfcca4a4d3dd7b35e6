Durban - Department of International Relations and Cooperation Minister, Lindiwe Sisulu, has hit back at a travel advisory issued by Australia which contained apparent misleading information about South Africa. Dirco took particular exception to the experiences of foreign tourists visiting South Africa.

In a statement to the media, Dirco said the travel advisory has the potential not only to deter Australians from visiting South Africa, but also to tarnish our country's image.

“Officials from the department have in the past requested, without success, that the advisory be amended to reflect the situation in South Africa as it relates to the true experiences of foreign tourists. The decision to escalate the matter follows these unsuccessful attempts and indicates the seriousness with which the South African government values the contribution of the tourism sector to the economy,” the statement read.

"South Africa remains one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world, and tourists in most instances have pleasant experiences of our country,” Sisulu said.
