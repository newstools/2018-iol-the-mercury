Durban - The N3 highway at Mooi River is open to traffic following violent protests in the area on Monday morning. 

Thousands of motorists were left stranded while large groups of people set fire to trucks and looted goods. Motorists were believed to have been travelling back home after spending the Easter weekend with family and friends.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

In the early hours of the morning, protesters living at the informal settlements nearby, blocked off the N3 north and southbound, the R103 and R62 near the toll plaza. They blocked off the road with burning tyres and debris. 

At this stage, the motive for the protest is not yet known. National Police Minister, General Bheki Cele, and provincial police management were expected to visit the area. 

“Police operations are already underway to manage the chaotic situation in Mooi River. The Public Order Unit of the SAPS is already on site,” Cele’s spokesperson, Nonkululeko Phokane, said.
