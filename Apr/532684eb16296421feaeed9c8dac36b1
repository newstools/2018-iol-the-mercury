Sihawukelwe said she was extremely excited to graduate alongside her sister. "We have surely made our parents proud since everything we do is for them."

Both sisters struggled financially to complete their degrees and are happy to be graduates.

"My older sister Nomkhosi, a UKZN lecturer motivated Mpumelelo and I to study further. It is through her resilience over the years that we both believed we could attain our postgraduate qualifications," said Sihawukelwe.

Mpumelelo’s advice to fellow researchers: ‘Time lost can never be regained. Procrastination is definitely the thief of time. Do not delay in doing things but rather work in advance to meet the set deadlines.’

Both Sihawukelwe and Mpumelelo plan to pursue their studies further.
