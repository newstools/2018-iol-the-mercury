Durban - A Chatsworth woman accused of killing, sexually molesting and torturing her 3-year old granddaughter, referred to as Baby X, has taken her secrets to the grave.
The 57-year-old accused, who has been an inmate at Westville Prison for more than two years awaiting the finalisation of the trial, collapsed and died on Tuesday.

The woman’s name cannot be divulged to protect the identities of the dead child’s two siblings, aged 11 and 14, who were also allegedly burnt with cigarettes, sexually violated and ill-treated.
The deceased's 35-year-old daughter - the child's mother - is a co-accused in the case which outraged the community when they were arrested in November 2014, after the emaciated body was found in a bed in their Havenside home. Baby X's granny, represented by attorney TP Pillay of Legal Aid South Africa, and her daughter, represented by advocate Murray Pitman and attorney Ajith Severaj, pleaded not guilty to all charges before Judge Mohini Moodley in the Durban High Court. 
After the accused were charged, Baby X's siblings were removed to a place of safety and have been there since the horrific child abuse allegations and the toddler's death. 
The case is to resume in June for closing arguments. 
It could not be established when and where the granny's funeral will take place or if her detained daughter would be allowed to attend.
