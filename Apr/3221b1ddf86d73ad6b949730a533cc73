South African President, Cyril Ramaphosa, also conveyed messages of condolences to the government and people of Algeria and the Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic.

President Ramaphosa said that many people in Algeria and Western Sahara are grieving the loss of their loved ones. 

"The people of South Africa share their pain and loss and extend their most sincere condolences to the families of those who lost their lives in this tragic accident," he said. 

Chairperson of the African Union Commission, Moussa Faki Mahamat, said this tragedy afflicts not only Algeria, but also the whole continent.

The crash happened shortly after the plane took off from Boufarik military airport near the capital Algiers, but reasons for the crash remain unclear.

Mohammed Achour, the chief spokesman for the civil protection agency, said the Russian-designed Il-76 military transport plane had been carrying soldiers.
