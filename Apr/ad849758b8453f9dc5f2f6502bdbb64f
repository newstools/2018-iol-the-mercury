A private investigation has revealed how a Chinese-owned company, Simuliya, has been manufacturing counterfeit mineral water for bottling companies in Zambia, among them Aquasavana and Aquarite, the Zambian Observer reported.
Furthermore, corrupt police officers have been accused of trying to cover up the scam - fearing exposure could destroy the mineral water brand.

Footage posted last Friday on New Diggers YouTube channel showed police officers from Kanyama raiding a bottling plant in an industrial area of the capital, Lusaka, where Chinese nationals Liu Guifen, Liu Heling and another identified as Jiang were operating the alleged illicit operation.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
During the raid, Liu allegedly attempted to stop the Intellectual Property Unit from filming the  premises where water was being pumped from a nearby pit into various bottles through a running tap.

“Thousands of water bottles bearing several brands were found at the warehouse with Liu’s family and a group of Zambian employees working round the clock to fill the bottles and load them on to trucks for distribution to different clients around Lusaka,” reported the Observer.

Despite the video footage showing the bottles being filled with water via the tap, Liu claimed the water was being purified before sealing at the request of his clients.

But Dr Mohamed el Sahili, director of Fairy Bottling which produces Aquasavana mineral water, claimed the Chinese nationals were taking empty Aquasavana bottles and filling them with fake mineral water.

After reporting the matter to the  authorities and getting little response he decided to investigate the matter personally. Pretending to be a customer Sahili called the Chinese businessmen and requested to purchase some of their products. He was told to come to where the water was being bottled.

Sahili also asserted that several top officers at the Kanyama police station tried to cover up the crime. - African News Agency (ANA)
