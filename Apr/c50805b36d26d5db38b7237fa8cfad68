Durban - Hundreds of protestors snaked their way from King Dinuzulu Park to the Durban City Hall in support of the South African Federation of Trade Union (Saftu) protest against working conditions and better pay on Wednesday morning.

Earlier, a large crowd had gathered in the park singing struggle songs and building up the momentum. A bakkie with loud hailer speakers attached to the roof blared out struggle songs and chants. ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
