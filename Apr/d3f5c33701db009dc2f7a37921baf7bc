Durban - Drakondale Girls Choir School is holding an open day on Saturday for all prospective learners in grades 6 to 9 who have a passion for singing and performing.
The school offers a private education for boarding or day scholars in a beautiful setting in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands, near Howick. Girls are given an outstanding music and choral education, with opportunities to perform regularly and tour.  

The school offers grades 7-9 (rollout to Grade 10 in 2019) in small academic classes with individual attention. Girls and their parents interested in attending are invited to the open fay from 10am, where they can hear the choir sing, tour the grounds and audition for choir director Judith Hawthorn.

In addition, the choir is performing at 2pm at St Joseph’s Seminary Chapel in Cedara (D546 road) to raise funds for the World Choir Games in Tshwane in July.

This competition sees thousands of singers from around the globe gather for two weeks of concerts and contests where the World Choir Games’ motto “Participation is the highest honour” encourages the making of musical friends to share in the common language of music.
