Durban - Claims that affiliates of the ­Federation of Unions of South Africa (Fedusa), Cosatu and National Council of Trade Unions (Nactu) had participated in countrywide protests yesterday have been dismissed.
SA Federation of Trade Unions spokesperson Patrick Craven released a statement claiming the affiliates had participated in the ­protests. 

“Workers who are not members of any union, the unemployed, students and members of the public are marching in several city centres of South ­Africa,” read a statement. ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

Fedusa secretary-general Dennis George described Saftu’s claim as ­nonsense. 

“Our affiliates would not have gone to the march because they don’t agree with Saftu’s demand on the minimum wage.”

Cosatu president Sdumo Dlamini said an appearance of the federation’s banners at the march would not have meant its affiliates had participated. 

“I don’t believe any affiliate of ­Cosatu would have been there as it is not a Cosatu strike.”

Dlamini said that while many ­Cosatu members reported to work, there were others who could not as they did not have transport. 

Nactu general secretary Narius Moloto said members of unions that did not apply to participate in the strike would have risked being fired by their employers. 

“We met the central committee on Saturday and made it clear that we cannot go on strike,” he said.

After the march, Craven said he was still gathering information on how many opposing affiliates had participated in the strike. “The strike was a success as many workers stayed away to march with us,” he said.
