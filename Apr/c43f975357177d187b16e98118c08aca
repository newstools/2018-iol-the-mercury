‘Mervyn from Durban’ is the brand new show from comedian Mervyn Pillay and it’s an introspective look into names, places and identity.
The shows, scheduled for Sibaya next weekend, April 27 and 28, are a personal take from the entertainer who has more than three decades in the industry.

Pillay, who grew up in Victoria Street, in central Durban, is one of three siblings. ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

“My father was a teacher and my mom was a ‘housewife’. I played on the streets, walking to the Goodwill Lounge, our ‘tea room’, for bread and remember getting treated to ice cream by my uncle, who worked at Clover dairy, which was near Adams & Griggs.

“My education was in cinema as I lived on the doorstep of The Dreamland, Liberty, Raj, Shiraz, Isfahan, Naaz, Avalon Albert and Topaz cinemas. I grew up on a diet of Indian film and martial arts movies. My heroes were Amitabh Bachchan and Bruce Lee.”

Pillay says the movie Breakin inspired a break dancing group he formed with his friends. “We called ourselves Executive Video Group and we danced at clubs such as Zone, Manhattan and Disco Dallas. Ruby Tuesday was a white’s only club - we had to dance and leave.”

Pillay says he took gymnastic classes with the main purpose of learning to fall. Somehow the laughs enticed him and the art of mimicry was what moved him a step closer to this goal.

“One day, at a show in Newcastle, the MC, Fakir Hasen, asked me what I would like to do. When he called me on stage it was as a comedian.

“He threw me into the deep end and it launched a career in comedy. I’ve never looked back.”

Early on, Pillay would imitate film stars like Johnny Lever and Eddie Murphy. His acts were part dance, part song and comedy. 

To this day, his unique ability to cross between genres has set him apart. This 90-minute show, with an age restriction of 13, is bound to be his most intuitive performance yet.

Tickets are R100 and R120 at Computicket.
