Durban - Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini is to be awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Zululand in recognition of his humanitarian work.
The honorary doctorate in social work will be bestowed on the king on May 4, for his “far-reaching vision and vital contribution in combating social ills among the youth and the society at large,” read a statement from the university.

As the 8th Zulu monarch, the king is also the chairperson of the Ingonyama Trust, a corporate entity established to administer the land traditionally owned by the king for the benefit, material welfare and social well-being of the Zulu nation.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

The university’s vice-chancellor, Professor Xoliswa Mtose, said the university was delighted to recognise the king, who founded the Bayethe Trust Foundation.

The foundation’s chief executive, Rhana Naicker, said the king was humbled by the gesture, saying it was important to maintain strong links with the university as a knowledge hub. 

“This honour recognises our partnership and is a testimony of the ubuntu concept that the King lives and breathes,” Naicker said.

The honorary doctorate will be conferred at a special graduation ceremony at the university’s KwaDlangezwa campus.
