“It is believed that a car's handbrake failed whilst the patient was walking past. The car then rolled, resulting in the patient becoming pinned up against a wall,” Herbst said. 

He said the woman sustained multiple-traumatic, life threatening injuries. 

“Due to the the remote location and time sensitive injuries, the patient was airlifted to hospital for urgent specialist care. IPSS Medical Rescues’ aeromedical division, operated by  Black Eagle Aviation, was called to assist ambulances crews with a critically injured patient,” Herbst said. 

Earlier in the day, one person was killed and another seriously injured in a crash on the N3

west bound just passed the Shongweni offramp.
