The young couple got married in 2013 while studying at the University.

"Our living and education expenses were paid from the money we made selling fruits at the University. Challenges of getting married at a very young age, still at university and financial problems didn’t stop us from reaching our dreams. We soon had a baby girl but were kicked out of university residence and had to rent. I had to drop out during my honours degree because I had to find a job to support my wife, her studies and the baby," said Sanele.

The couple thanked UKZN’s Vice Chancellor, Dr Albert van Jaarsveld, for offering assistance after hearing about their financial woes. 
"We have survived the worst together but we managed to continue studying. I had a tuck-shop in my university residence which we both ran against the rule of the University, but we had to find ways to survive. Having a baby, both working and studying was not easy but we want to encourage young people out there that it’s possible," said Sanele.

He and his wife are currently seeking employment.
