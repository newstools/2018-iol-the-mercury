GOA: The Goa Health Ministry this week ordered a probe into the state’s first organ harvesting and transplantation exercise, five days after the kidneys and liver of a 60-year-old patient were transported to Mumbai and transplanted to two people admitted at two hospitals.
The probe ordered by Health Minister Vishwajit Rane follows complaints by doctors who claimed ailing patients in need of organs in the state where the donor died should have had preference.

“Dr Mahesh Panche, assistant lecturer, department of casualty emergency medicine, is directed not to leave the state. Dr Mahesh shall make himself available for the enquiry till its completion,” reads the note signed by the dean of the Goa Medical College and Hospital, Pradeek Naik.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

Panche, attached to the casualty department of the state-run health facility, was serving as the co-ordinator of the exercise which involved harvesting of the organs from the deceased 
patient on Friday. The organs were then transported by police to the Dabolim International Airport before being flown to Mumbai by a special flight.
