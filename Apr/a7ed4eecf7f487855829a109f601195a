Cívil proceedings to recoup some R155million from the architect who worked on the renovations to former president Jacob Zuma’s Nkandla homestead, Nkandla, should get under way in the next few months.
Briefing Parliament’s portfolio committee on justice yesterday, Special Investigating Unit (SIU) head Lekhoa Mothibi said the withdrawal of architect Minenhle Makhanya’s attorneys had meant they had to “almost start afresh with the new lawyers”.

The SIU instituted the civil litigation after it was found that the upgrades to Nkandla were found not to be security-related by the former public protector. ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

Zuma was later ordered to pay back R7.8m because the upgrades had unduly benefited him and his family.

SIU legal counsel Gerhard Visagie told MPs, that Makhanya’s new attorneys were on board, meaning the trial could get under way in the next few months, barring any more delays.

“This matter has met with a number of what can only be called delaying tactics. The new attorneys are now on board. The case is well advanced,” he said.
