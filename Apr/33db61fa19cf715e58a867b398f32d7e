"Our Tactical Response Team, along with Amanzimtoti SAPS Crime Prevention conducted a patrol and spotted the car. It was noted, by our Rapid Response Officer that the car was circling around the area. After some time, the said vehicle was seen parked outside the pedestrian entrance of Arbour Town and a decision was made to approach the car," he said. 
Lokker said when the car was searched, it was found that there were false registration plates put over the car's original plates. 
"We also found housebreaking implements and other tools," he said. 
Lokker said all six men were detained for further processing as they are believed to be linked to a spate of other crimes.
