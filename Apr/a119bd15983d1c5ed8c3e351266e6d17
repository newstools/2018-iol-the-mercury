It is alleged that on January 13, Nyoni police were alerted after the community grew suspicious about the mother and son’s disappearance.

“Community members also assisted the policed and while they were at a relative’s house who was last seen with the victims, the members saw a fresh grave and they became suspicious. The members and the community started to dig the said grave and on their surprise, they found the bodies of the two missing people. The body of a woman was chopped into pieces and wrapped in plastic,” police spokesperson, Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane, said. 

Buthelezi then went into hiding in Eshowe and was found by police. He was duly convicted and sentenced in the Mthunzini High Court on Wednesday. 

The Acting Provincial Commissioner, Major General Bheki Langa welcomed the sentenced handed down to the accused who had no mercy in killing his own blood relatives. “He received a befitting sentence that will teach and give strong warning to other criminals who want to commit such barbaric crimes. I further commend a team of detectives who work around the clock investigating and tracing the accused after he fled the area for hiding,” he said.
