Durban - The Twitter detectives may have found one of the men involved in Saturday night’s riot at the Moses Mabhida Stadium. Following a call from police to assist in identifying the culprits responsible, the unofficial Twitter force of “Tweetectives” sprang into action in pursuit of the men.

Although one of the men has apparently been found and hails from Pinetown in Durban, police have yet to confirm. Images of the man have surfaced on social media and the Tweetectives believe he played a part in the destruction of the stadium. Equipment, valued at millions of Rands, was destroyed during the riot when hundreds of soccer fans invaded the pitch following Kaiser Chiefs' 2-nil loss to Free State Stars in the Nedbank Cup semi final. 

Meanwhile, the KZN MEC for Arts, Culture, Sport and Recreation, Bongi Sithole-Moloi has also urged residents to help identify the men involved in the incident.

 


She has strongly condemned acts of hooliganism and violence that took place.

“There is no place or justification for violence in football and society in general. We cannot tolerate such hooliganism and thuggery in football. We call upon the police to ensure that those responsible for the violence are subjected to judicial processes, Sithole-Moloi said.

“The citizens of KZN are football lovers and we do not tolerate any acts of violence against any member of society. We would like to wish all of those affected by the incident a speedy recovery and we are thankful that there are no fatal casualties as a result of the senseless acts,” Sithole-Moloi said.
