Durban - A rural KwaZulu-Natal community will officially become majority shareholders in a game reserve, more than a decade after they were awarded land restitution. Deputy Minister of Environmental Affairs, Barbara Thomson, on Thursday handed over the Mayibuye Game Reserve to the community of kwaXimba in the  Umkhambathini Local Municipality area.This is part of the wildlife economy project which received R10 million and was implemented through the department's Extended Public Works Programme (EPWP). This is aimed at guiding the sustainable growth and provide a basis for addressing constraints to the growth of environmental sectors.The Mayibuye Game Reserve has made significant progress since the funding, with a 45km wildlife fence being rected, gate house and offices built and two houses refurbished into the project offices. Wildlife, including zebra and wildebeest, have been brought in. The project has already unlocked  R100 million private investment for the development of the eco-estate.Almost 80 job opportunities have been created and 15 field rangers trained and employed. The beneficiary communities will have a 51% shareholding in the reserve.The Mercury
