“This falls in line with the additional budget adjustment granted to the Youth Development Office in the budget adjustment. The Youth Office has a nine projects with a total budget of R10 million to implement the projects. The report states that young people are a major human resource for development and often act as key agents for social change, economic expansion and innovation,” he said. 

The programme of action has therefore been prepared with the complete understanding that young people must determine their own development trajectory. The report also acknowledged that challenges facing young people are urgent and important with immediate intervention needed to deal with youth challenges.
