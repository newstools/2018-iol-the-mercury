"Reports from the scene indicate that five male suspects, three armed with pistols, stormed the property after posing as construction workers, accosting the female homeowner and assaulting her. The suspects ransacked the living area, making off with a firearm and various electronic equipment," he said. 
Van Reenen said the woman's husband and brother-in-law arrived at the premises, confronting the fleeing suspects, who fired a shot. 
"Remarkably there were no injuries sustained. Crisis Medical paramedics assessed the victims on scene and they declined any further medical care," van Reenen said. 

The scene was secured and handed over to the South African Police Services for further investigation and processing.
