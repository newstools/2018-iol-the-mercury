Durban - Terror accused twin brothers Brandon-Lee and Tony-Lee Thulsie saw another postponement to their pre-trial hearing on their alleged terrorism plots in South Africa
at the South Gauteng High Court on Monday.
The twins appeared in court in high spirits, wearing black robes, and grey kufis (Muslim headwear), with shackles on their feet. 

Greeted with smiles from five women from their family, the twins walked into the courtroom expecting another postponement.  ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

Yesterday both the State and defence team requested that the matter be adjourned so that additional evidence could be obtainedbefore setting an official trial date.

State prosecutor Chris MacAdam told the court he had discussed with the brothers’ counsel matters of disclosure, and had to reschedule the trial to give them enough time.   

There have been a number of postponements in the case, lasting over a year due to the complexities involved, according to the National Prosecuting Authority’s spokesperson in Gauteng, Phindi Louw Mjonondwane. 

The Thulsie twins were arrested in raids in Newclare and Azaadville on the West Rand in July 2016.

Both the State and the defence agreed to postpone the matter to May 30.
