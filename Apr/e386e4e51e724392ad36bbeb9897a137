Durban - Grade R teachers picketed outside the Education Department’s head office in Pietermaritzburg on Tuesday, demanding that they be paid salary increases that are 12 months overdue.
The picket was organised by the South African Democratic Teachers Union (Sadtu). 

Another picket was scheduled for Wednesday, when the teachers were expected to hand over a memorandum to the head of department, Dr Enoch Nzama. ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

About 5800 Grade R teachers are affected. They were supposed to have received a salary increase of R500 in April last year. This would have taken their salaries from R6500 to R7000. 

Sadtu provincial secretary Nomarashiya Caluza said the salary increase had been made last year but not implemented.

“These teachers spent their Christmas and Easter without those salary increments.” 

Caluza said they did not believe the department did not have the funds and suggested its spending priorities were the problem. It was reported recently that the department is in financial distress. 

“Look at what the teachers are asking for and compare that with the millions spent on the oversupply of sanitary towels that are sitting in schools and of no use to anyone,” Caluza said.

Department spokesperson Muzi Mahlambi said they were constantly in negotiations with the unions. “The issues raised by the teachers are not new. We have been addressing them with the unions. It is just that the teachers have decided to take them out of the boardroom,” he said.
