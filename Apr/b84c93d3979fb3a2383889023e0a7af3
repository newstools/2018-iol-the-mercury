During the izimbizo the municipality will present the draft budget and the draft Integrated Development Plan (IDP) to communities.

“It is important that we adopt a People’s Budget that has input from our citizens. We will have community meeting, izimbizo and stakeholder engagements including radio programs. We will take the public opinions into consideration on the final document. I urge all councillors to participate in the hearings especially members of EXCO irrespective of their party affiliation. It is important that we all work together for the good of our people,” she said.

She also urged councillors to take part in these processes irrespective of their political party affiliation.
