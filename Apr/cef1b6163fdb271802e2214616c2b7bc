Durban - President Cyril Ramaphosa joined thousands of people in the 12km fun walk during the 33rd Annual Gandhi Walk to take place in Lenasia, Gauteng on Sunday. Also present at the march was Reverend Jesse Jackson. 

The walk is organised annually as a fundraiser by the Gandhi Walk Committee (GWC) to create a fun social platform for nation building, good health and promote community awareness.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

This year, the central theme for Gandhi Walk 2018 was “Going Green” aimed to champion social change and promote community awareness to change attitudes and behaviours towards climate change and greener-living.
Ramaphosa's option to lead a healthier lifestyle is not new for locals. Earlier this year, he was spotted talking a walk along the Sea Point Promenade. Ramaphosa said he was on a mission for his "tummy to fall". This sparked hysteria on social media with the hashtag, #TummyMustFall trending on Twitter. 
In February, Ramaphosa and about 200 others started an early morning walk from the Gugulethu sports ground to Athlone Stadium promptly at 5.30am on Tuesday after a warm-up.
