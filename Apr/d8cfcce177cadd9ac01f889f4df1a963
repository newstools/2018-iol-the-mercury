"Whilst firemen worked to cut her free Advanced Life Support paramedics worked to stabilise her. Once freed the lady went into cardiac arrest and resuscitation efforts began, after a short while paramedics regained a pulse and the lady was rushed to a nearby hospital where she died a shot while later," he said. 

Jamieson said the woman's teenage son sustained moderate injuries and was also transported to hospital. 

"Two other drivers were also treated on the scene with one being critically injured as result of the fire after the crash. Both men were transported to hospital," he said. 

In a separate crash, earlier in the day, three people were treated for injuries sustained when two cars collided in Glenwood. Jamieson said the patients were 

stabilised at the scene before being transported to a nearby hospital for the further care that they required.
