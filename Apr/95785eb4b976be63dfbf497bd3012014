Durban - Business rescue practitioners running the Gupta-owned mines have entered into a management agreement with investment group Burgh holdings after failing to secure transactional banking facilities for these companies.

According to the agreement, the Burgh Group will provide “critical services to ensure the continuity of these operations to the benefit of the employees, contractors and suppliers.”ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

Business practitioner Louis Klopper said the management agreement will bring banking facilities thus allowing the Optimum Coal and Koornfontein mines to continue operating.

Since the beginning of the month, the Gupta owned businesses have been unbanked owing to the Bank of Baroda closing down its South African operations.

“All efforts to secure transactional banking facilities for these entities were unsuccessful as the commercial banks remained concerned about their reputational risk,” Klopper said.

The Burgh Group’s Ezimbiwayo Consulting, which boasts expertise in resource exploration and the financial management of mining operations recently concluded an assessment of the mining operations.

It had found that the mines owe a combined R500 million to creditors including the R43 million owed since January to Transnet Freight Rail and the R17 million owed to RBCT by Optimum Coal.

“It is very clear from this assessment that these operations are in desperate need of TLC, management and a significant cash injection,” Klopper said.

Some of the findings by Ezimbiwayo included smouldering stockpiles which have become a fire and an environmental hazard due to exposure to elements.

The business rescue practitioners said they foresee that the mines will be able to generate an income of R200 million per month from  exporting the 200 000 tonnes and this excludes the income to be generated from the existing contract to supply Eskom.
