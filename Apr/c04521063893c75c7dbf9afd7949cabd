Durban - Eskom has reacted to allay fears of possible winter power cuts, following news that some of its power stations were running low on coal.
Energy analyst Chris Yelland said seven of Eskom’s 15 power stations had low stockpiles of coal, which could lead to load-shedding. 

“The latest coal supply ­reports suggest that Eskom’s current coal supply problems are as serious - if not worse - than those experienced shortly before the load shedding of 2008,” he wrote.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

Eskom spokesperson Khulu Phasiwe confirmed that some power stations had problems, but said it was not necessary to 
panic. 

“At this stage there is no fear of load shedding.We are diverting coal from stations that have more than enough to those that are in a difficult situation,”  he said.

Phasiwe said that out of the seven power stations, three were supplied with coal by the Gupta-linked Tegeta mines. 

“They have declared the hardship clause, because they are unable to supply coal for a number of reasons.”
