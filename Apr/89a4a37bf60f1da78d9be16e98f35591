SAN FRANCISCO: Facebook plans to revise the written policies that people agree to when they use the social network, it said yesterday, adding language about the protection of personal data as it prepares to comply with a strict new European law.
The world’s largest social media company has been hammered by investors and faces anger from users, advertisers and lawmakers after a series of scandals about fake news stories, election-meddling and privacy.

Last month, Facebook acknowledged that personal information about more than 50million users wrongly ended up in the hands of consultancy Cambridge Analytica. Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg will testify about the matter next week before the US House Energy and Commerce Committee, the panel said. ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

The company published draft revisions of two documents that apply worldwide, its terms of service and its data policy, and was seeking feedback on them.

At more than 4000 words, the draft of the new data policy is about 50% longer than the existing one.

Facebook last revised its terms of service in January 2015 and its data policy in September 2016 - Reuters
