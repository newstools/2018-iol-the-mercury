She said claims are initiated against insurance covers. 

Gumede was reading from a detailed report compiled following Saturday's chaos during the Nedbank Cup semi final between Kaiser Chiefs and Free State Stars. 

"The stadium is fully functional despite the events of the weekend. There have been no cancellations of bookings. In fact, an African National Congress event was hosted at the stadium the next day. There is a long list of damaged property, including bins, dinner plates, chairs and tables," she said. 

Gumede said she was grateful to all the law enforcement agencies, including Metro Police who responded. 
Eighteen security guards were injured when angry fans stormed the pitch. Twelve were treated at the scene while the remaining were taken to hospital. They have all since been discharged.
