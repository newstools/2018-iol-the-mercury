Durban - Gauteng motorists who default on paying their e-toll fees are in danger of losing their licences should the demerit system of an amended road act come into effect.
The DA and civil lobby group Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa) are enraged following a public hearing in Mamelodi, Tshwane, last week, where it emerged that motorists could be punished with suspension of their licences when amendments to the Administrative Adjudication of Road Traffic Offences Act (Aarto) are enacted.

The draft Aarto Bill was passed by the National Assembly last September, and is currently with the National Council of Provinces (NCOP), where public hearings are being held. This comes as Gauteng Premier David Makhura’s office confirmed yesterday that President Cyril Ramaphosa had agreed to put in place measures to resolve the e-tolls impasse, which Makhura said had “not worked” in the province.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

Rudie Heyneke, Outa’s portfolio manager for transport, said it emerged at the public hearing that ignoring signs at e-toll gantries urging motorists to settle their debts could be an infringement akin to disobeying road traffic signs under Aarto regulations gazetted in 2008. This, Heyneke said, was according to an answer to him from Road Traffic Infringement Agency’s (RTIA) chief operations officer, Thato Tsholetsane.

RTIA spokesperson Monde Mkalipi confirmed that e-toll violations were under discussion under the new Aarto regulations, but that this had not yet been finalised.
