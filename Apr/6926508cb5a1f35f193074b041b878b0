Police teams proceeded to a house in Esikhaleni, after receiving a tip-off. They then searched the house. 

Police spokesperson, Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane, said cell phones, suspected to have been taken during house robberies, were also found in the house. On further investigation, it appeared that the suspects were wanted for a number of house and business robberies in and around Esikhaleni and Richards Bay area.

In a separate incident, police recovered more than 700 kilograms of dagga in Ezakheni, near Ladysmith. 

Zwane said officers had set up an operation, searching for wanted criminals, when they stopped a bakkie in Helpmekaar Road. 

He said the driver’s suspicious behavior led police to believe that he was drunk. 

“The vehicle was stopped and on further investigation it was established that the vehicle was laden with bags of dagga. The recovered dagga weighed in at over 700 kilograms. The drugs have an estimated street value of R100 000. The 35-year-old driver was charged with dealing in dagga,” Zwane said. 

The man is set to appear in the Ezakheni Magistrate’s Court.
