According to local councillor Nhlalayenza Ndlovu, the looters were mainly community members from the neighbouring Bruntville area but they were not involved in the protest. The protest is believed to have been over a truck drivers’ labour dispute.  

KZN Department of Transport spokesperson, Kwanele Ncalane, commended law enforcement agencies for responding timeously to the scene, dispersing protesters and cleaning up to minimise the impact on the busy end of Easter weekend traffic.

He said they would continue monitoring the area.

The area was also visited by National Police Minister, General Bheki Cele. Thousands of motorists, travelling back to Johannesburg, were left stranded on the highway. Many had to find alternate routes while the authorities rushed to clear the area.
