“They accosted a worker and forced their way inside the home. The homeowner who was at home at the time, was confined to a room and tied up along with his staff member,” van Reenen said. 

He said an armed man stood guard while his accomplices ransacked the home, stealing flat screen televisions, laptops and jewellery, before making off in the homeowner’s vehicle. 

“The stolen vehicle, a silver grey Nissan Duke, was fitted with a satellite tracking device and was later recovered by C-Track in the Inanda area. The suspects remain at large,” he said. 

In a separate incident, at the weekend, two men were arrested for allegedly attempting to rob an off duty police officer in Palm Boulevard, Umhlanga. 

On Saturday night, van Reenen said their security team noticed a vehicle matching the description circulated following the attempt.

“Marshall Security armed response were immediately dispatched and the vehicle was picked up travelling on Chartwell Drive in the Umhlanga Rocks CBD.  A high speed chase ensued onto Umhlanga Rocks Drive with the suspects attempting to evade arrest,” he said. 

Van Reenen said the vehicle was brought to a stop near to the Guildford Avenue intersection where the two men were apprehended and later positively identified by the victim,” he said. 

The men were handed over to police.
