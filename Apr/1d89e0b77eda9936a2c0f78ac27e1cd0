Durban - The 4-year-old Phoenix girl whose brutal abuse was captured in a viral video has been released from hospital, almost a month after she was admitted. 
The video was captured by her mother’s boyfriend, who seemed to be goading her as she beat the child to the ground. 

The couple, who cannot be named to protect the identity of the 4-year-old child, was arrested after the video was anonymously brought to the attention of Alvin Brijlal, founder of the Victims Outreach Information Centre (Voice), who reported the abuse to police.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

The mother initially reported that it was the boyfriend who was abusing the child and was by the little girl’s side in hospital. However, police later confirmed that the mother had also been arrested and the pair charged with culpable homicide. 

The couple was granted R3000 bail each but the boyfriend later handed himself back over to police after a car, reportedly belonging to his parents, was burned by an angry mob outside his home. 

Police spokesperson Major Colonel Thulani Zwane however, confirmed on Monday, that both were out on bail. 

Attorney Kelvin Walker, who is acting for the child's biological father, confirmed that the child was discharged from hospital last week and was doing; “much better.”

Her mother and boyfriend are due back in court on Wednesday.
