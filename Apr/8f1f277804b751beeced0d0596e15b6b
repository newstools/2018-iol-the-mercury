Local rapper Cassper Nyovest has claimed he passed on an opportunity to watch #Beychella and meet Queen Bey and turned it down.  Why would you turn down a chance to Beyoncé? Apparently work is more important. 


The 'KsazobaLit' rapper tweeted that a "lead singer of one of the biggest bands in world" invited him to the second Coachella weekend but seems to want to keep the name of the singer on the down low since he doesn't name the person.

He then adds that he would've met the Queen and was close to packing his bags but because of work and self-discipline, he decided to pass on the opportunity.


 

 

Since Nyovest doesn't name the lead singer, it makes it hard to verify his statement and his followers trolled him because of it by starting the #CassperDisciplineChallenge.

 I was invited by Mama Winnie to come collect the signal because it couldn't get past the toll gates. I kindy declined the opportunity to see God. My discipline though!#CassperDisciplineChallenge pic.twitter.com/H7clIr9QGH
