Police spokesperson, Captain Nqobile Gwala,said about 1000 community members had started protesting around 3pm, soon after the child died.

Gwala said the protests led to the closure of Link Road, Shallcross.

No arrests have been made.

DA councillor Sharon Hoosen said it was unclear how the 
accident happened. 

“Our city needs to do more to implement measures to protect our children on busy roads, especially those that are close to informal settlements.”

Hoosen said she had asked for traffic calming measures to be implemented on this road for many months.

She said she hoped that the municipality would now make this a priority.

She added that the violent response to the tragedy by the community was understandable.

“We must not condone lawlessness in any form. But this is just their way of venting their frustrations.

“The children in this area also do not have a place to play in. As a result we find them running or playing on the roads.”
On Monday morning, the road was open to traffic shortly after 9am.
