NORRISTOWN: Retired supermodel Janice Dickinson testified that comedian Bill Cosby drugged her under the guise of giving her a pill for menstrual cramps, then raped her at a Lake Tahoe, Nevada, home in 1982.
Cosby, who played the lovable patriarch and “America’s Dad” on The Cosby Show, is standing for his second criminal trial on allegations of drugging and sexually assaulting former friend and colleague Andrea Constand, 45, in 2004.

“I wanted to hit him, wanted to punch him in the face,” said Dickinson, a highly successful model in the 1970s and 1980s. “I felt anger, was humiliated, disgusted, ashamed.” ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

Dickinson is among 50 other women who have made similar accusations - all cases too old to prosecute. Five accusers are being permitted by Montgomery County Judge Steven O’Neill to tell their stories to the jury in a suburban Philadelphia courtroom. 

Describing a similar scenario to three previous accusers, Dickinson said Cosby contacted her and offered help with her career. She had an uneventful meeting at his home in New York, but he phoned her again while she was doing a calendar shoot in Indonesia. He invited her to fly to Lake Tahoe to meet him for more career counselling.  

Dickinson testified she met Cosby and his musical director for dinner and complained of menstrual cramps. “I have something for that,” Cosby said, according to her testimony.  He gave her a little blue pill, which she swallowed. Cosby then took her back to his room. “I remember his breath, the taste of his kiss, cigars and espresso. Here was ‘America’s Dad’ on top of me, a happily married man with five kids, and how very, very wrong it was,” Dickinson said. 

Confronting Cosby later that day, she demanded to know why he did it. His response was silence and a facial expression that conveyed “You’re crazy,” she testified. 

Dickinson said she did not report the assault to police out of fear it would destroy her career. - Reuters
