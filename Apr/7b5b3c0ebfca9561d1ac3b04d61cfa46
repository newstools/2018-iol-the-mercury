BRUSSELS: EU privacy watchdogs will look deeper into the harvesting of personal data from social networks for economic or political purposes following the scandal engulfing Facebook after data from nearly 87 million users was improperly accessed.
“A multibillion-dollar social media platform saying it is sorry simply is not enough,” Andrea Jelinek, chairperson of the group of EU data protection authorities, said in a statement yesterday. Facebook has been rattled by the revelation that the personal data of tens of millions of its users ended up in the hands of British political consultancy Cambridge Analytica - which has counted US President Donald Trump’s election campaign among its clients.

"What we are seeing today is most likely only one instance of the much wider spread practice of harvesting personal data from social media for economic or political reasons,” Jelinek said after a two-day meeting of the regulators.

The group had to formulate a long-term strategy, the statement read, although it did not include details of the steps it might take.

A landmark data privacy law will enter into force in the EU on May 25.

It will give Europeans the right to know what data on them is stored and the right to have it deleted. Under the new law, companies will need the explicit consent of users before using their data and they will have to be more specific about how they use it.

Companies that break the law could face fines of up to 4% of their annual global turnover. - Reuters
