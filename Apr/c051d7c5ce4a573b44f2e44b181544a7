Former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela tweeted this morning: “Happy birthday former President Jacob Zuma. Blessings in the year ahead.” She later tweeted a similar message for Gordhan. 








Madonsela’s message for Zuma however solicited the most responses with some even casting doubt on Madonsela’s sincerity. “Are you mocking our former president??? I mean, the year ahead is filled with in and out courts, arguments, etc…,” one Twitter user asked, while @murray_fm asked: “Is Blessing the name of his cellmate.”  
Some of Zuma’s ardent supporters also took to social networks to sing praises for the former president.
