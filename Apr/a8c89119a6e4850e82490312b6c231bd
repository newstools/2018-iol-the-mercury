Durban -  Former president Jacob Zuma told thousands of supporters outside the Durban High Court on Friday that his opponents were telling lies and he would be proven innocent in a corruption case against him.

Speaking in Zulu, Zuma said that the judiciary and politicians believed that he did not have rights.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

"The truth will come out. What have I done?" Zuma told the cheering crowd. "I am innocent until proven guilty." 
Zuma told his supporters that the reinstated charges against him had been politically motivated. 
“I am being targeted because of my stand on radical economic transformation. There are people who want me silenced because they are the people who want the majority of black people to remain poor while they remain rich.
Zuma said it is clear that while others have rights he does not share similar rights.

“I don’t understand why I am being charged twice. I also don’t understand how charges have been dropped because the matter was never in front of the courts (after 2005).”
Zuma appeared briefly in the Durban High Court before Judge Themba Sishi. He will next appear in court on June 8.
