Norristown -  Deliberating jurors in Bill Cosby’s sexual assault case have asked their first question of the judge.
The jury returned to a suburban Philadelphia courtroom less than two hours into its deliberations to ask for the legal definition of consent.

Judge Steve O’Neill said he couldn’t answer, telling jurors they were already given the definitions of the charges they were considering.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

Prosecutors said the 80-year-old comedian drugged and molested a woman at his home in 2004.

Cosby is charged with three counts of aggravated indecent assault, each carrying a maximum sentence of 10 years.

The prosecution and defence gave jurors plenty to think about after a two-week trial on charges that Cosby had drugged and molested Andrea Constand at his mansion in January 2004.

His lawyers say Cosby’s encounter with Constand was consensual. 

The defence says Constand falsely accused Cosby so she could file a suit against him. 

Cosby paid Constand nearly $3.4 million (R39.8m) in 2006.

Cosby’s first trial ended without a verdict after jurors deadlocked.
