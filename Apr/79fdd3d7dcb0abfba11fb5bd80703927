Rescue Care paramedics attended to the scene in the early hours of Saturday morning. 

According to Rescue Care’s Garrith Jamieson, emergency crews had to cut through the wreckage of the bakkie to extricate on the injured. 

Jamieson said a total of five patients sustained injuries ranging from serious to critical with two of the critically injured being placed on manual ventilators before being transferred to hospital for further care. 

“One person was ejected across Dr Pixley kaSeme Street. The man went into cardiac arrest and after unsuccessful CPR at the scene, he was declared dead,” Jamieson said. 

Two others died in hospital a short while later. 

The youngsters’ friends and family took to social media following the horrific crash, to express their condolences.
