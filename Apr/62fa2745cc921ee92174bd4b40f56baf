The N3TC advised motorists to delay their trips and be extremely cautious. Police have also warned drivers that the R62 and R103 were affected by the protest.

It is believed that the irate protesters blocked off the roadway with burning tyres and debris. They then proceeded to burn trucks and a fuel tanker. The group also looted the trucks and prevented members of the Road Traffic Inspectorate from clearing the area. The protest is believed to have started in the early hours of the morning. 

Drivers travelling back to Johannesburg, are advised to use the R33 Pietermaritzburg to Greytown then take the R74 Greytown to Colenso then get back onto the N3.

The protest takes place during one of the most busiest periods of the year, when thousands of people are expected to return home after the Easter holidays.
