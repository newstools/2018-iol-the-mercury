Durban - Cosatu in KwaZulu-Natal will use its May Day rally to strengthen relations between affiliated trade unions, provincial secretary Edwin Mkhize said.

“Strengthening unions means recruiting, retaining and servicing our membership because there are many workers who are not members of unions. We want to revive relevance of trade unions as a way of building strong workplace to consolidate their unity and organisational power,” Mkhize said.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

He said this year’s theme will reflect on protecting jobs and pushing for economic transformation. 

Despite refusing to take part in a strike against the R20 per hour National Minimum Wage organised by Saftu last week, Mkhize said Cosatu was still committed to making the lives of workers better.

“The national minimum wage is a step towards the living wage. We had no reason to strike over something that will benefit the workers. The minimum wage will see wages rise for the 47% of workers (6 million), who earn less than R20 an hour currently,” he explained.

Among worker issues, Cosatu will be shining the spotlight on is the legacy matter of labour brokers, inefficient transport infrastructure and the raising of value added tax by 1%. 

“We are going to mobilise workers to bring this country to a standstill if government doesn't want to ban labour brokers. Workers are struggling to get to work on time because of trains that break down with no alternative transport provision.

“We also want treasury to reverse the vat increase, we want them to revise the 19 food items exempted to vat to be reviewed, it is outdated and perpetuates poverty,” he said. 

He added that Cosatu will also be fighting racism, the gap between the rich and poor, gender based violence and for descent jobs.

The march will start from the Durban City Hall to Curries Fountain on Tuesday.
