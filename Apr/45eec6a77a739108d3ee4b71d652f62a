Durban - The stage goes dark and silence envelopes the auditorium. The star makes her big entrance, and the crowd goes wild.
Peppa Pig is a global brand worth $1billion (R2bn) a year, showing in 180 countries with 218 episodes aired in five seasons.

She’s taken over my TV, my home and my life. Every parent with a toddler under the age of five knows what I’m talking about.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

So when I heard Peppa Pig Live was coming to SA, I made it my parenting duty to get my three-year-old daughter to the Cape Town show no matter the cost. Watching the reaction to  the cartoon character on stage was beyond belief. The show centres on Peppa, her family, a few friends, and takes on the same format as the TV show. 

There was a scene change every 10 minutes, a break in between, lots of song and dance - a winning formula for littlies. Mine loved it!

Next stop for Peppa Pig Live is The Playhouse Company (Durban) from April 20 - 22.
