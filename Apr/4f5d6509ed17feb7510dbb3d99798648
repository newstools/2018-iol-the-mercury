At this stage, the motive for the shooting is unknown. 
An elderly neighbour was on her way home when she saw the police vans and emergency vehicles parked on the road. The woman, who asked not to be named, said she had to walk home from the doctor's surgery as the roadway was closed to traffic while police combed the area for evidence. 
The woman said she was left traumatised by the ordeal. 
"If I did not go to the shop nearby, I would have been caught in the middle of that," she said. 

The critically injured man was rushed to hospital in a critical condition.  

A man has been arrested in connection with the shooting. He is believed to be from a rival tow truck company.
