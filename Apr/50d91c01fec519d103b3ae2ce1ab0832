While the violence which broke out at Moses Mabhida Stadium on Saturday night has been largely blamed on Kaizer Chiefs supporters, a man whose family claim he is an Orlando Pirates fan appeared in court yesterday charged with public violence and pitch invasion.
Phelelani Jojisa, a 32-year-old from Mayville, appeared briefly at the Durban Magistrate’s Court before being remanded back into 
custody pending another appearance tomorrow.

He cut a lone figure in the dock wearing a blue T-shirt with what looked like a bloodstain. His sister Nontethelelo wept outside court, telling journalists that her younger brother was no criminal or hooligan. ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

In fact, she said, Jojisa supports Kaizer Chiefs’ arch-rivals, Orlando Pirates, and thus had no reason to invade the pitch - unlike the other fans allegedly angered by the 2-0 loss their team had just suffered to Free State Stars.

“The State needs to look for and arrest the real culprits. It is the Kaizer Chiefs fans who did this; Phelelani is no criminal,” she said.

The accused’s cousin, Nhlanhla Gwija, who was also at court, told The Mercury that he was equally confused by the arrest of his ­cousin.

The family had spent all of Saturday night and Sunday trying to locate Phelelani, and they learnt only yesterday that he had been arrested.

“According to the people who were with him at the stadium, he had gone onto the pitch while trying to escape the chaos in the stands. He has no business with Chiefs,” Gwija said.

Initially police had said two people had been arrested in connection with the incident, but Phelelani was the only one to appear in court.

Police spokesperson Brigadier Jay Naicker said charges against the other suspect had been withdrawn    as he could not be linked to the case.

Naicker said the police were ­working around the clock to identify and bring the perpetrators of the ­violence to book.
