Durban - Police have confirmed that 54 people were charged with public violence after violent protests erupted on the N3, near the Mooi River Toll Plaza on Sunday night. KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbhele, said a total of 35 truck were damaged, including those that were set alight. "It is believed that the people who were protesting and throwing stones as well as burning objects, had caused extensive damage to property. Local police and neighbouring police stations were mobilised and dispersed a number of people who were looting the burning trucks. A total of 53 people were arrested and will face charges of public violence. The arrested suspects will appear at the Mooi River Magistrate's Court on Monday," she said. Mbhele said while the situation remained calm on Monday, the roadway was still closed to traffic due to the burnt trucks blocking the road. "Police are still monitoring the situation and are on high alert. Traffic is being diverted through alternative routes," she said.

Commenting on the matter, Langa said it was unacceptable and police will not condone the behaviour. "We will not have people venting their anger by damaging private and public property by blocking our national roads. We will intensify our operations and ensure that those responsible face the full might of the law. Any person who blocks our national roads will be treated like a criminal," he said. Langa added that there were many ways for people to voice their grievances but resorting to criminality was not one of them. Motorists travelling back home after the long weekend have been advised to map out an alternative route in the meantime. It is alleged that a group of locals are up in arms at the employment of foreign nationals as drivers. However, police have not confirmed this. The Mercury
