Durban - A Durban woman, charged with the attempted murder of her 4-year-old daughter, will not be allowed interaction with the girl. The same applies to the woman's boyfriend, who filmed the incident. The couple, who cannot be named to protect the identity of the child, appeared in the Verulam Magistrate's Court on Wednesday. 

Previously, the Verulam Family Court ruled that the couple not be allowed to make contact with the child - directly or indirectly. The decision was made pending the testimony of a therapist who has been seeing to the little girl. The therapist is scheduled to testify on May 2. ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
The State then made an application for this to be added to the couple's bail conditions. This was then added. This decision will be upheld until the interim order made by the family court is finalised. 

The incident grabbed the attention of the community last month when the video clip surfaced on social media. The clip shows the mother smacking the child, who had allegedly peed in her bed. The mother initially reported that it was the boyfriend who was abusing the child and was by the little girl’s side in hospital. However, police later confirmed that the mother had also been arrested and the pair charged with culpable homicide.
The couple was granted R3000 bail each but the boyfriend later handed himself back over to police after a car, reportedly belonging to his parents, was burned by an angry mob outside his home.
