Durban - Two hundred newly recruited Metro Police Officers are currently undergoing training after completing a rigorous recruitment process and 200 more are due to begin their training in the near future. The lucky recruits were successful out of the 47 000 applicants who responded to the vacancy advertisement in October last year.
According to Metro Police spokesperson, Senior Superintendent, Parboo Sewpersad, they have been seeking to implement the ‘Bobby on the Beat’ programme again and the new recruits are being trained for that purpose. AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
"The normal procedure was followed when the recruitment process was undertaken. Applicants that met the requirements had to undergo a physical assessment which comprised of a 2,4km run, push up, sit ups, and shuttle runs to test their physical fitness. Applicants were eliminated at each phase of the fitness test if they did not meet the requirements. Applicants who passed the fitness test then wrote an aptitude test and were interviewed," he said. 

Applicants were further eliminated if they had a criminal record. 
Metro Police would like to put on record that all allegations of corruption when the application process had begun is being dealt with and would like to assure the public that the process of recruitment has been fair and as per the processes followed by the municipality.
