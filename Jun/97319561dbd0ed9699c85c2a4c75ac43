Durban - eThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede has slammed recent land grabs in the city saying the city’s administration should do everything in its power -  including taking legal steps - to prevent these.

Her comments come as there have been attempts to invade the Silverglen nature reserve in Chatsworth where a group of people had started clearing the bush with the intention of building structures.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

Gumede asked city manager Sipho Nzuza to properly investigate the Silverglen land grab. Addressing the city’s executive committee on Tuesday, Gumede spoke very strongly against the land grabs saying some communities were now living in fear because of this.

She also spoke out against the destruction of property including municipal buses during recent protests.

“We cannot afford to have private and public properties being destroyed as if we are fighting against apartheid system. The burning of municipal buses and cars is wrong. The invasion of public and private land is also counterproductive. 

"We are busy discussing our Land Policy and others are being encourage to occupy private and public land. Such actions are self-defeating and counter revolutionary. The illegal occupation of land and land grab will deprive the rightful owners of land and also disrupt plans of development,” she said.
