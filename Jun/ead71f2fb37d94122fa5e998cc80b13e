Durban - Rock-throwing victim Sashni Daniel may finally be discharged from hospital and go home this week.
The 27-year-old suffered a severe head injury in February  when a rock was thrown over Shaka’s Rock bridge on to the car in which she was a passenger on the N2 highway.

Shaka’s Head residents protesting against an electricity outage are believed to be responsible for the incident as they had blocked the road with burning tyres and rubble to force the KwaDukuza municipality to restore electricity to their 
homes.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

Since the incident, Daniel has had multiple brain surgeries, suffered blood clots, meningitis and a stroke. 

Her father Kovi Daniel told The Mercury that Sashni had been moved from the specialist Inkosi Albert Luthuli Central Hospital to Stanger Hospital last week. 

“Although we are expecting her to come home this week, now we’re only five minutes away from the hospital so we can see her more often,” he said. 

The family had struggled to afford to see Sashni as often as they wanted. 

Members of the public had come to their aid, helping with cash and kind to allow Kovi and his family to make the almost hour-long trip to the hospital. 

“She smiles every time she sees us, she needed her family 
on her road to recovery. Now she just needs to recuperate a bit more, then my baby can come home,” said Kovi. 

Sashni - who worked at a jewellery shop in Ballito - lived with her father and his elderly parents, who all rely on social grants. She was the breadwinner. 

Kovi has been concerned about preparing their home for Sashni’s return, but he said an orthopaedic bed was already waiting for her. 

“A very kind lady sponsored it just out of the kindness of her heart. There are so many people who have come forward to help, and I know many continue to pray for her. 

“Captain Vinny Pillay from the Umhlali police station has been a godsend. May God bless all these people and their families,” said Kovi.
