Speaking on the event, station commander Lieutenant Colonel Raj Ramchunder, said they were excited about the day. 

"For us, this is about bringing the community and police together to learn more about each other. Also to build a good working relationship between the police and residents in our community. We as police provide a variety of services and the Crime Awareness Day will showcase that. It will also enable the community to get to know us. We must not be seen as two separate entities," Ramchunder said. 

There will be displays by members of the SAPS K9 unit, Search and Rescue, Explosive unit, Public Order Policing, the SAPS Airwing and music by the SAPS band.

For the kiddies, there are jumping castles, pony rides, face painting, foam fun with the local Fire Department and of course, lots of candyfloss and popcorn. The day promises to be fun for the whole family with lots of stalls and food on offer.

There is also a mini soccer tournament and lots of prizes on offer.

The Crime Awareness Day will take place a the Hillary Primary School grounds on Saturday, 18 August from 8am.  Entrance is free.
