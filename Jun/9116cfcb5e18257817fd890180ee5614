Lebohang Mahloane clocked in at 32:03 for the boys while Ntombomzi Tywalana came in at 37:51 for the girls.
Mahloane, originally from Free State, said the participation of senior athletes pushed him to work harder to achieve good results. 
“The race was difficult because I ran with seniors and I managed to hang on to them until the finish. I saw a lot of kids running the 5km and I want to encourage them to keep on running, believe in themselves and believe in God,” he said.
The 19-year-old Tywalana from Newcastle, said she managed to improve on her performance from last year’s race. 
“I ran very well and I’m happy with the time I made. Last year I ran over 40 minutes but this year I made 37 minutes. I wish to encourage other youth to participate in sport and work hard. Through sport we are able to socialize, meet other people and go to different places without having to pay for it. It also keeps us away from many wrong things,” said Tywalana.
The first prize winners walked away with R2000 each. 
The event featured a 5km and 10km race.

Over 4000 runners from schools and clubs around the Province participated in this year’s race.

Acting Head of Department of Sport and Recreation, Ntokozo Chonco, said they were happy with the overall participation of young people in this race. 
“This event is very significant for the Province of KwaZulu-Natal because it is our way of celebrating youth month. Our Premier Willies Mchunu and MEC Bongi Sithole-Moloi are saying to the people of KwaZulu-Natal, especially the youth, stay away from drugs, stay away from alcohol, concentrate on living healthy. Numbers that we see today will encourage more of our youth to participate in sport. As the Department we will continue to organize such programmes to avail more opportunities to young people from rural areas and townships to participate in sport,” he said.
A number of Comrades Marathon runners also used the race as a warm up for the Comrades Marathon.
