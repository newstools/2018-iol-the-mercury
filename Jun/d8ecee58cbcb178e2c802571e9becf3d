Durban - Somali refugees have called on the South African government to implement integration strategies between them and locals as part of community building a more inclusive society.

On World Refugee Day, leader of the Somali Association of South Africa, Muhidin Badel says social exclusion maintains a “us and them” situation with locals which leads to tensions and sometimes xenophobic violence.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

“It's important that we are educated on South African languages and culture. When we can communicate with the people some of the problems are solved, in other countries its compulsory,” he said.

Badel, who has been in the country for 20 years says bridging the gap between refugees and locals will ensure cohesion and peaceful existence.

“We need to learn about each other and understand one another,” he added.

Badel said “most” South Africans are good people and that he had never been singled out and mistreated but remains concerned about resurgence of xenophobic violence.

“What I  have faced are what all foreigners come across, xenophobic violence and the impact it has on your business and social life is devastating.

“When we live together, we understand each other and seeing each other as neighbours, brothers and sisters it will be difficult to hurt each other on the basis of where one was born,” he explains.
