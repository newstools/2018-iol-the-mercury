Durban - The father of slain student Zolile Khumalo says he is relieved her alleged killer abandoned bail, saying he is “a danger to society”.
Comfort Khumalo was speaking after the brief appearance of Thabani Mzolo, 23, at the Durban Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday.

 



Mzolo is accused of killing 21-year-old Zolile, who was a first-year quantity surveyor student at the Mangosuthu University of Technology, last month. 

She was shot in the chest, in her room at an off-campus residence, in front of other students. 

Yesterday, attorney Charl Claassen told the court that his client no longer wished to apply for bail. Speaking to The Mercury after the hearing, Claassen said he and his client had agreed it was not the right time to apply for bail as this was a high-profile matter with emotions running high and so he was concerned about his client’s safety. 

The murder sparked outrage among students. Claassen said some people in the public gallery had taunted Mzolo. 

This was in reference to Mzolo’s previous 
antics in court where he had made a sign of pulling a trigger and, at another appearance, had showed the middle finger. 

“He was not directing it to the court or any of the officials. He was reacting to what was being said to him by people in court,” said Claassen, who advised his client not to do this again. 

Mzolo’s antics had rubbed salt in the wounds of Zolile’s family. Her father said it was difficult to see Mzolo but he wanted to see justice being served. 

State prosecutor Khanyi Gcwabaza asked for a postponement as there were outstanding issues in the investigation, including a post-mortem report, DNA results, a photo album of the crime scene and a statement. 

She and Claassen did not object to magistrate Mahomed Motala’s suggestion that Mzolo appear from the Westville Correctional Facility via audio visual on August 29.
