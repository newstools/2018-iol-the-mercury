Durban - As part of the inner city regeneration programme that is being driven by the eThekwini municipality, a multistorey Durban CBD building had sections of its upper floors closed on Tuesday. 
Municipal officials inspected the building, which is located at the corner of Monty Naicker and Yusuf Dadoo streets, and found several issues of non-compliance, including workers sleeping inside their working areas, a multitude of fire hazards and construction infractions.

“There are multiple non-compliant issues with the building. Several trading shops were created using drywall partitioning, which must have a fire rating that requires a certificate. We have to have approved plans for all of this, which we don’t have,” said Graham Estice from the Building Inspectorate.

“The staircase is unsafe and people walking on the stairs could get hurt, as well as people walking underneath. Someone could fall and break a leg,” said Estice.

Officials on site said they had found beds inside a clothing factory located on the second floor that accommodated 15 employees.

School uniforms were found inside the factory, including for top private schools in Durban.

While the electricity meter was connected legally, according to officials, the wiring was deemed a hazard and the Building Inspectorate advised the owner of the clothing fac­tory to vacate the premises.

The city said it was using a multidisciplinary approach to deal with bad buildings, which  involved numerous departments within the city including the metro police, Land Use, Building Inspectorate, Durban Solid Waste, and Business Support, among others.

“There are two teams, A and B, in operation, and in this team there are close to 90 people who start at 6.30am and move through different zones,” said Estice.

The municipality said the campaign was part of an ­effort to regenerate and renew the CBD of the inner city and other key economic hubs. 

“The Inner City Regeneration Programme offers eThekwini municipality an exciting, yet challenging, opportunity for regeneration of its main economic hubs. 

“This operation tackles illegal trading, illegal businesses, illegal dumping and other contraventions,” said the head of the Development Planning and Environment Management Unit, Musa Mbhele. “Our message to landowners and landlords is to have a safe environment for people to work in, which abides by the by-laws of the municipality to ensure safety.”

Sudesh Naicker of Land Use Management said the zoning of the property allowed for an industrial building, but it did not allow for excessive heavy industrial use that would cause smoke, dust or fumes. 

“What we found here is completely unacceptable, therefore we will need to ­investigate and request that this building be shut down until they are able to comply,” Naicker said.

Officials said that when they called the owner of the building, he said he had not been aware of what was going on inside. He was given 30 days to comply.
