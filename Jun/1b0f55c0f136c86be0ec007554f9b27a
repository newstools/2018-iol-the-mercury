Durban - An inquest has been opened after an elderly man was thrown off a boat at Shelly Beach on the KwaZulu-Natal south coast on Tuesday. National Sea Rescue Institute's Craig Lambinon said three men were on a motor boat when the man fell while the boat was exiting to go out to sea. 
"Bystanders were able to recover the man from the water while the boat was able to turn around and beach," Lambinon said. 
He said the NSRI crew was alerted and rushed to the scene, accompanied by ambulance and police. 

We believe bystanders were able to recover the man from the water while the casualty boat was able to turn around and beach.

"Upon arrival at the scene, the man was found lying on the beach. Sadly, despite extensive CPR efforts conducted by paramedics the man was declared deceased after all efforts to resuscitate him were exhausted," he said. AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
