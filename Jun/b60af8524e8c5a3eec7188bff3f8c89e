Durban - Metered taxi operator, Mozzie Cabs announced on Sunday that the company has closed down.

The taxi service which transported residents in and around the greater Durban area had been running for almost 20 years.

"Mozzie Cabs has been the leading metered taxi company in Durban for almost 20 years but sadly today are forced to close our doors due challenges in the economy and within the cab industry. Unfortunately we have had to close without notice so as to prevent possible loss or damage to our assets. " said managing director and owner of Mozzie Cabs,Â Peter Lehman.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

Lehman said that the company will have limited administration function and apologised to customers for closure without notice.

"We would like to sincerely thank all our loyal customers for your support during our time in business. we hope you enjoyed riding with us and sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused through this closure without notice. " he said.

Last year in an interview with IOL, Lehman said the metered-taxi operators had predicted in 2013 that Uber would put them out of business and he believed that Mozzie Cabs would be lucky to remain open until the end of the year.

The cab company survived six months longer than Lehman predicted.
