Police also made a discovery of 250g of heroin with an estimated street value of over R40,000-00 as well as 84 counterfeit DVD’s.  

Naicker said that these items were found abandoned with nobody to account for them.

“We will not hesitate to act if information comes to light of illegal activities taking place even if it is on our own premises. It is very important that we get our own house in order for the safety of our citizens as well as our police officers that live in those buildings,” said Acting Provincial Commissioner, Lieutenant General Mkhwanazi.
