DA Shadow Minister of Home Affairs, Haniff Hoosen, said they found that many refugees and asylum seekers were reportedly being victimised during their application process. 
He said the DA delegation further conducted oversight visits to Refugee Reception Offices (RRO) around the country in order to see first-hand the effects of the closures of the Cape Town and Port Elizabeth Reception Offices. 
"Both RRO’s remain closed despite court orders instructing that they be re-opened. The tardiness of the department in complying with these orders has caused immense hardship to asylum seekers, often constraining their ability to renew their documentation in time," he said. 
Hoosen said to cut down on illegal immigration, the DHA must become efficient at both processing asylum applications, and at documenting all entrants, departures and applications to stay in the country.  It is also vital that the department work with border control management to secure our porous borders. This is crucial for the foreign nationals in the country, as well as for the security of South Africans.

"The need for order in the country cannot be overstated. If DHA fails at ensuring that those who enter the country do so legally and are documented, it creates chaos which can be directly traced back to their door-step," he said.
