South Africa's diamond, Minnie Dlamini is living her best life in Russia and we can't help but live vicariously through her Instagram page. The star is in Russia for the 2018 FIFA World Cup and has been there since the first match earlier this month. The star has spent most of her time in Moscow, the capital city and has been seen in St Petersburg and taking cruises in Moscow city. She was also joined by her husband, Quinton Jones but he had to jet back to Mzansi. Here are our favourite pictures from Minnie's Russian adventure.
