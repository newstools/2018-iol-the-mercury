Durban - Power giant, Eskom, has stopped Stage 1 load shedding. This was confirmed in a media statement issued on Thursday, just before 8pm. 

According to Eskom, restoration of power may take longer in some areas. 

Via a media statement, Eskom thanked its customers for assisting in keeping the power system stable by reducing their energy usage. 

"We urge all South Africans to use electricity sparingly and wisely. We sincerely apologise for the inconvenience to affected customers," Eskom said. 

Earlier in the evening, Eskom issued a statement saying they would have to commence with Stage 1 due to electrical constraints. However, an alert was later issued stating that they had stopped Stage 1 load shedding.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

They said the national power system had been constrained as a result of ongoing industrial action.

"Eskom calls on all consumers to assist by reducing their electricity consumption to reduce the risk of load shedding by switching off geysers, electric heating, pool pumps, and all non-essential appliances tonight from 5pm to 8pm," the utility said.  

Eskom had mobilised responders across the company and at the time, was working with other national structures and stakeholders to keep its plant operating in the context of current industrial action. 

"As a last resort, Eskom will implement its power system contingencies, including controlled load shedding, to avoid a blackout/shutdown of the national power system," the earlier media statement said. 

Eskom said that in the event that load shedding becomes necessary, they and the municipalities will use published load shedding schedules.

For Eskom customers, these schedules are available on the Eskom website (loadshedding.eskom.co.za). Eskom customers can also contact the Eskom customer contact centre at 0860 037 566.
