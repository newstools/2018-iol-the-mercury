Durban - The youth of 1976 paved the way for youngsters to stand up and stand behind what they believe in. Since then, we have seen more and more young people standing up for their rights.
Whether it is the right to free education, fair treatment in the classroom or to be heard, young people have taken a leaf out of the book of the class of ’76. 

The Mercury spoke to the head girl and deputy head girls at Maris Stella and others to find out what Youth Day meant to them. 



What is Youth Day about?

Youth Day is celebrated on June 16 to commemorate the deaths of many Soweto schoolchildren who died in 1976, when protesting against learning Afrikaans in schools.

 

What are the challenges facing the youth of today?

The youth today are challenged with many issues, including a battle to establish themselves.  Due to their access to social media, the youth are faced with unrealistic expectations and the judgement of others that hinder their success in formulating their beliefs, and therefore their self identity.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads



How can they, with the help of the community and government, overcome those challenges?

In order for the youth to successfully establish themselves, they need the support of the community.  We need to speak up, using platforms such as classrooms, community events, slam poetry, debating, etc, discussing issues and problems we have in common, and be heard while working together.



What lessons can the youth of 2018 learn from the youth of 1976?

Today’s youth are able to identify the power of the youth in 1976, and learn how capable they are to stand up for what they believe in.  The youth of 1976 are seen as an inspiration to today’s youth.

Bongulwazi Mavimbela, 27


What is Youth Day about?
It is a day where we celebrate most of the young people in South Africa despite their colour, race or background. It’s a day where every young person needs to come together and talk about the challenges we face as the youth of South Africa

What does Youth Day mean to you?
I think it’s an important day of our young people's history. A day where we look back at where we come from and where we want to go.

What strides have been made by the youth, since 1976?
The best uplift was the #FeesMustFall strike, which affords us free education for all and which was the main goal of the youth in 1976 so I think the goal is common.
What are the challenges facing the youth today?
I think the challenges the youth of today are facing are almost similar to those that were faced by the youth in 1976.

How can we work together to better assist the youth of today in making better decisions?
I think education is the key to everything. The more people are educated, they will be less ignorant and more conscious of what is happening around them and they will make better decisions in future.

What lessons can the youth of 2018 learn from the youth of 1976?
I think that the youth of 1976 stood up for what they wanted despite the challenges they were going through. I mean, it was the apartheid era but they stood up and formed a united front and fought for what they wanted.

Aviwe Klaas, 24 

What is Youth Day about?
To me Youth Day commemorates the youth of 1976, and what happened to the youth of 1976.
What does Youth Day mean to you?
It means freedom.
What strides have been made by the youth, since 1976?
Recently, we have seen youth take part in the #FeesMustFall movement for free education and debate about the NSFAS(National Students Financial Aid Scheme) and so forth. Everything that has happened is because of the freedom that we, as students and the youth of today, have.
How can we work together to better assist the youth of today in making decisions?
People, not only those in the cities, should be made aware of the opportunities they have. People should be informed of the choices they have currently, because our future has been fought for.
What lessons can our youth learn from the youth of 1976?
To work collaboratively, because the youth of 1976 were in partnership. Now when people were fighting for their rights, for example during the #FeesMustFall campaign, others were relaxing at home. If we work collaboratively we can achieve a lot in life.

What is Youth Day about?
Youth Day to me is freedom day to the youth of South Africa.

What does Youth Day mean to you?
It means I’m free to get education, I’m free to get everything in South Africa.

What strides have been made by the youth, since 1976?
Free education. We are well educated now, because of the youth of 1976. We have bursaries, we have access to everything because of that youth.

What are the challenges facing the youth today?
Unemployment. Even if they are educated, they don’t get employment and [endure] poverty.

How can we work together to better assist the youth of today in making better decisions?
To educate them, give them the opportunities. Education is the key to everything.

What lessons can the youth of 2018 learn from the youth of 1976?
What they can learn is to fight for what we want; you have to fight for it.
