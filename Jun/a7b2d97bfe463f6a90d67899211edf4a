Durban - The community in Mbuthumeni, Harding could know by the end of the weekend whether the rocks they have been digging up contain real gold.
The area, which is also known as KwaMachi, has seen an influx of “miners” after yellow, glittery rocks were found by a road construction team about two weeks ago.

Local iNkosi Mthetho Machi said the rocks had already been sent for testing, and they were waiting for the results.  “The results could come back on Friday (today) or they could be made available to us by Monday. AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

“Should it be gold, it would create a number of much-needed job opportunities,” he said.

The site where the rocks were found has been cordoned off with barbed wire, and yesterday hundreds of people were told by the police to leave the site. The police said the site had to be closed due to safety concerns as there had been a rockfall on Tuesday in which two people were injured.

However, people cut through the fence and returned to the site early yesterday morning, leading to clashes with the police and private security guards. The police said on Thursday a 29-year-old man was arrested at the site after he was found in possession of a stolen gun.

“The preliminary investigation revealed that the firearm was stolen in Pinetown on June15, 2017,” said Police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala. 

The digging at the site has caused tensions in the area, and local residents armed with sticks went to the site yesterday to evict the diggers. 

They also held a private meeting at the house of the local iNduna.

Machi acknowledged the tension and said he was monitoring the situation and would be addressing the matter with other local chiefs to prevent any clashes. He said, for the past week, he had been speaking to the people urging them to stop digging.
