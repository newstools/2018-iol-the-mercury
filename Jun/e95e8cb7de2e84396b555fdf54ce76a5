Durban - Residents who frequent the plush uMhlanga Rocks promenade have been left furious after sewage was seen leaking down the hill and onto the beach this week. 
Durban councillor, Heinz de Boer, was on site on Wednesday and took a video of the sewage running down onto the popular beach. It is believed that the leak stems from a blockage in one of the nearby pipes. AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
When The Mercury queried the leak with the municipality, they were unaware of the issue as a complaint had not been lodged with them. 
Later, Acting Head of Communications, Mandla Nsele, said the relevant unit was handling the matter. 
"The relevant Unit has been tasked to investigate the leak and remedy accordingly," he said. 
Nsele urged residents to report all leaks to them via the city's 24 hour call out number on 080 1313 013 or email Eservices@durban.gov.za
He said they have a dedicated team of staff members who strive to provide superior service to all city residents. 
"Service delivery remains our key priority," he said.
