Meiring said paramedics assessed the patients and found that two men had sustained numerous injuries and showed no signs of life. 
"Unfortunately, nothing could be done for them and they were declared dead. Three other patients, all men, were found on the scene. One man was found in a critical condition while the two other men were found with moderate injuries," Meiring said. 
He added that paramedics treated the patients and provided the critically injured man with advanced life support interventions.
