DURBAN - Former president Jacob Zuma told a strong crowd outside the Durban High Court that free education should not only be free, but compulsory. Zuma was addressing the crowd after appearing in court on a litany of charges, which include fraud, corruption and racketeering. His case was postponed to July 27 and moved to the Pietermaritzburg High Court.Outside the court, Zuma supporters, who had come out in their numbers in ANC green and yellow, filled the high court precinct. Addressing supporters, he said the Freedom Charter was clear in that free tertiary education should be free and compulsory. "The Freedom Charter does not say education will only be free, it also says it will be free and compulsory. This is important, let us not ignore compulsory and pretend it is not in the Freedom Charter, it is there. If we want to implement that clause, let us make it free and compulsory. As black people we were deliberately starved of education so that we remain poor, as we are now," said Zuma to applause.
