Durban - About half of the children who were moved after a fire ripped through the Edith Benson Babies Home, will soon return to a familiar place. 

Child Welfare Durban and District president Rajan Pillay said they had made space for these children in two cottages at the William Clark Gardens Othandweni Child and Youth Care Centre, which is on the same property as Edith Benson.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

After the February fire, the 55 children rescued were taken to four different homes with their caregivers. 

Pillay said the investigators had said it was evident from the burn pattern that the fire was caused my a electricity wiring problem. 

He said the home been inspected about a month before the fire and a safety certificate given. The fire- which was noticed by one of the children- had spread so quickly because of the buildings age. 
“It's over 60-years-old  so the rafters were really dry allowing the fire to spread quickly,” said Pillay. 

He said while the property was insured, a payout was preferred to a like-for-like rebuild of the home.  
“The board is looking at  getting in specialists with experience in building world class children's homes. We try and provide an environment as you would get in your home, make it so that the children have everything they would experience if they were at home with family,” said Pillay. 

Several companies and and professionals has expressed an interest in getting involved in the project which the board wants to to be world class in terms of the safety standards, layout and aesthetics, he said. 

This would include fireproof mattresses as per Department of Social Development norms and standards.
