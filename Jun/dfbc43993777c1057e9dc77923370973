Durban - Beach-goers in Durban are urged to be wary in the coming days as sharks nets have been removed to allow for the fun and action of the Sardine Run. eThekwini Municipality on Thursday announced that bathing on beaches in the south and central areas will be closed temporarily. 

"The closure is effective immediately and beaches will only be re-opened once the Sardine Run has passed through. The Sardine Run is a highlight of the season along the KwaZulu-Natal coastline and attracts numerous tourists and fishermen to the region," said the city's Acting Head of Communications, Mandla Nsele. AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

The KwaZulu-Natal Sharks Board has removed its nets ­between Scottburgh and Port Edward, and is looking to ­remove more as the sardines move up the coast.

“We do this so we don’t catch the dolphins, Cape gannets and sharks following the sardines,” said KZN Sharks Board head of operations, Mike Anderson-Reade.

He said it was exciting to see the sardines along the KZN coast as they had not been seen in large numbers for a number of years.

“It is very difficult to try to predict when and if this spectacle will reach KZN, and the timeline could be anything from a few days to possibly a week or two. Should the fish continue northwards, it appears that we may be in for one of the better sardine runs seen in a long while,” he said.
