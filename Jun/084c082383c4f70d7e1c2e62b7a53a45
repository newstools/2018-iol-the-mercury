Durban - A high-level delegation from eThekwini and the provincial government - led by eThekwini Mayor Zandile Gumede  and KwaZulu-Natal Finance MEC Belinda Scott -  yesterday departed for the United Kingdom, where they will spend the next four days turning up the charm to attract potential investors.
Accompanied by a team of prominent business people, including Vivian Reddy and representatives from entities such as the KZN Growth Coalition, Invest Durban, the Durban Chamber of Commerce and ­Industry, the delegation aims to successfully promote both the province and Durban, as a premier investment destination.

“The message the delegation will be taking there is that Durban and the whole of KwaZulu-Natal is a perfect investment destination. AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

“If you look at Durban and the province for example, we have the biggest port in Africa, we have the best infrastructure,” said Mthunzi Gumede, the spokesperson for mayor Zandile Gumede.

He said the delegation will be in Newcastle until Thursday and the trip will culminate in a series of prearranged business investor meetings, to be held in the British capital, London, on Friday.

Gumede said the Newcastle leg of the mission will not only focus on strengthening the sister city link between Durban and Newcastle but also to explore opportunities within the various sectors, such as maritime trade and coal mining. 

“The delegation will travel within the North East (Newcastle, County Durham and Tees Valley) to participate in round table engagements, with both industry and political influencers, and to participate in networking sessions and business to business/one-on-one investor meetings to promote their projects and strengthen sister city links with Durban,” he said.

Upon arrival in London, Gumede added, the delegation will meet with British Airways post the announcement of the new direct route between ­Durban and London, which was announced last month. 

Direct flights will not only allow holiday makers to escape the cold northern winters but also link business travellers to the busiest port in Southern Africa.
