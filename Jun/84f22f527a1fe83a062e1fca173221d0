Govender said if confronted by a hijacker, the driver must get out of the car slowly. 

“Try and angle your body sideways so you are not facing a firearm head-on. Also remember to protect your head with your arms and avoid direct eye contact with the hijackers but try to take in as much information as possible, such as what they are wearing, and the sound of their voices. Most importantly, try to remain calm,” he said. 

In light of the recent fatal hijacking, Govender has offered the following tips to motorists: 


When parking, reverse park for a quick exit (also at home!)Always be particularly vigilant when you leave a shopping centre. Hijackers could have spotters working in the centre to be alert for any big purchases or cash withdrawalsKeep your car keys on hand when approaching your vehicle, do not fumble in your handbag as this shows you are off guardLook out for any suspicious objects near your car before getting inIf you suspect you are being followed, put your indicator on and slow down at least two to three houses prior to your home. If you are being followed, you will force the vehicle behind you to pass and this could cause the criminals to lose interestAlways make sure you can see the back wheels of the car in front of you when you stop in the traffic. This gives you enough room to maneuver and escapeAdjust your speed when approaching a traffic light so that you do not have to come to a complete stop where at all possibleChange your driving route and routinesAlways remain vigilant when approaching home. Research shows that most people relax the closer they get to home and this is often when they are most vulnerableBe on the lookout for people standing near your gate or driveway and ensure that the area around your gate or driveway is well litPhone ahead to give a relative or friend your expected time of arrivalGet to know your neighbours and the cars they drive. This will help to identify any uncommon vehicles in your area


 

What should you do if you do find yourself face-to-face with a hijacker?

 

“The golden rule is to not antagonise the hijackers who are probably more scared than you are. You need to show them you are not a threat. Lift up your arms to show you have no weapon and will surrender. Use your left arm to undo your seatbelt and put your car in neutral,” Govender said.


Seven tips on what to do if you are held up

“We encourage the community to be as proactive as possible and recommend having a remote panic on hand in case you encounter an emergency at your front gate.
