The hundreds of delegates paid attention whenever Zikalala spoke but continued to disrupt Mantashe.
Each time Mantashe tried to speak, some of the crowd broke out in song, singing - Wenzeni uZuma (what has Zuma done wrong).
"Unfortunately I am going to speak here tonight. If this is a conference of the ANC I will speak unless it is a meeting of a faction then I will not speak," Mantashe said, trying speak above the singing delegates.
Earlier on NEC members Bheki Cele and Jackson Mthembu were booed as they were introduced by Zikalala. 
The media was told to leave the venue as it became clear that the conference was turning chaotic.The conference has been adjourned and will reconvene on Saturday at 8am.
