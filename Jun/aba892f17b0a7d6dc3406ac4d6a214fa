Durban - Dundee, in northern KwaZulu-Natal, came to a standstill as hundreds of residents took to the streets burning tyres and barricading roads on Wednesday.

Residents who spoke to The Mercury complained that they could not access the town as all the major roads leading to and out of the town had been blockaded.

The protestors have listed a number of grievances which include unhappiness with the state of some of the roads, unhappiness with rates increases while they also demanded a school in Ward 6.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele said “about 600 community members engaged in a protest, complaining about service delivery, they blockaded the roads with rubble.” 

Xolani Nsele, the deputy secretary of the IFP in the area, said some of the protestors had stoned cars and looted some shops but this was not confirmed by police.

“Many shops are now closed here and we sense that there might be a political motive behind this march as much as some grievances might be justified,” Nsele said.

Mbele said the protesters had made their way to the mayor’s office where they were due to deliver a memorandum of their demands.

“No injuries and no case has been opened. School children were sent back to their homes for safety reasons. Dundee police and Public Order Police are in the area to monitor the situation and prevent any criminal activities.”

It is understood that the protestors demanded that the memorandum be accepted by an official from the Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs department.

Spokesperson for the Department of Education, Kwazi Mthethwa, condemned the protests saying it had targeted some schools in the town. He said teaching and learning was affected at Dundee Secondary, Thalana Secondary and Ethangeni Comprehensive schools. “Our officials are monitoring the situation,” he said.
