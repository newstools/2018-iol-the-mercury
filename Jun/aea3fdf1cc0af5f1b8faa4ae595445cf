Durban - A large police contingent has been deployed to stop the violence in Mtubatuba, north of the KZN, that erupted on Monday morning.

Pierre Conradie of Alpha security said about 20 police vehicles were at the scene this morning.

He said the violence looked to have started as a community service delivery protest and quickly got worse with trucks being the main target.

“The community stopped some of the trucks and looted the cargo, some of trucks had been tipped to the the ground others had been forced off the road and another had been burned,” he said.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

He said one wood truck had lost part of its load on the road but that had  been partially cleared and the despite the damage and debri on the road, the road had been partially cleared.

“When I left there about around 9am this morning, traffic was able to move around and had started flowing.

RTI spokesperson Zinhle Mngomezulu said two trucks had been burned in what looked to have started out as a community protest.

The attacks on trucks come shortly after trucks were burned in the Mooi River toll plaza a few weeks ago.
