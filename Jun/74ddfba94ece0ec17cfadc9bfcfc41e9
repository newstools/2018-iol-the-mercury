The Professional Board for Dental Assisting, Dental Therapy and Oral Hygiene, under the ambit of the Health Professions Council of South Africa (HPCSA), is cautioning the public against teeth whitening by Beauty Salons.

Dental Therapy and Oral Hygiene.

Based on the above regulations only appropriately trained, qualified and experienced oral health care professionals who are registered with the Health Professions Council of South

Africa may perform teeth whitening procedures.

“Section 34 of the Health Professions Act provides that no person shall practise within the Republic any profession outside the scope of which has been defined by the Minister of Health in terms ofSection 33 (1).” said HPCSA.
It is therefore, illegal and in contravention of the Health Professions Act, (Act 56 of 1974), for Beauty Salons or any persons who are not registered with the HPCSA as oral health care practitioners may perform teeth whitening. 
Beauty salons are advised to refrain from performing teeth whitening procedures which they have not been educated and trained to perform.
