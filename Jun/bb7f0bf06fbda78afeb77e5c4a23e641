Durban - For Penny Miskin, Sunday’s Spar Women’s Race was very special ­because she ran in memory of her daughter, Chelsy-Robyn, 3, who died in 2015.
The 44-year old woman from Ballito said that since a pool accident had claimed the life of her toddler, she had been living in a bubble of grief. 

Running had helped her start to ­reclaim her life and her health.

“Every time I’m tired and I want to stop, I think of Chelsy and I know that she would’ve been my biggest cheer leader,” said Miskin.

Miskin said the women in the race, who were “from all walks of life and come together to celebrate being women”, reminded her of all the mothers who reached out in her time of need.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

“The Spar Women’s race is really great, it brings women of all types ­together. I’ve always been amazed at the spirit and camaraderie of the women taking part. 

“The happiness and laughter carry you along and you get swept up in the atmosphere,” she said.

Wearing pink-and-white butterfly stickers in honour of Chelsy-Robyn, Miskin finished the 10km race with her friend Angela Dick, who had encouraged her to get fit and run again.

Mother and daughter team Rashida and Aneesa Kader, who were at the race, said it was “great to see everyone trying to be fitter”.

Rashida, 64, who was dressed in Chatsworth Athletic Club clothing, said she had been running the Spar Women’s Race since it first started.

“I run this race with my daughter to encourage her to become a runner like me,” she said.

Daughter Aneesa said:“My mom is very inspirational, she pulls me through when I am not feeling too good in the race, and she’s just amazing.”
This year’s top three runners were in first place, Betha Chikanga with a time of 33:07 and second place went to Glenrose Xaba, 33.27 while Nolene Conrad came in with a time of 33.43.
