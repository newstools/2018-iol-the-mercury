Mudslides and rockfalls are also possible. As it is exam time, students in rural communities should be advised when making their way to and from school."The report also includes these precautionary measures from the South African Weather Service: Strong, gusty interior winds over the interior increase the risk of runaway fires, therefore the public are advised not to start any fires or leave fires unattended under these conditions.When encountering flooding: If possible stay indoors and off the roads, avoid crossing rivers and swollen streams where water is above your ankles. If trapped in a flooding situation whilst in a vehicle, rather abandon it and climb to higher ground. In buildings, move valuables to a safe place above the expected flood level. Switch off electricity at the supply point to the building.In rural areas protect/relocate animals to a safe place on higher ground. Abandon your home immediately if evacuation is recommended by duly authorized officials, before access is cut off by flood water.NEVER drive on a road covered or obscured by water. You do not know how deep it is or if the road has been washed away. If the vehicle stalls, leave it immediately and seek higher ground. Be especially cautious at night when it is difficult to identify flood hazards. Listen to the radio or TV for warnings and obey the instructions from Disaster Management officials.The South African Weather Service said that it will continue to monitor any further developments relating to this weather system and will issue subsequent updates as required.Updated information can also be found at www.weathersa.co.za as well as via the SA Weather Service Twitter account @SAWeatherServic@TheCapeArgusCape Argus
