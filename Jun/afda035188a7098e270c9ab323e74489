South Africa’s very own Queen B, Bonang Matheba has turned down an offer to be on Tumi Morake’s show, #WTFTumi. On Tuesday night, #WTFTumi tweeted that they were still waiting on Mzansi’s greatest presenter to honour her invitation to be featured on the show. 

Before she could give the final answer on whether she’ll be part of the show or not, Bonang’s fans advised her to turn down the offer, and so she did. AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

In her response to # WTFTumi, Bonang said: “Lol. My supporters say I mustn’t come to your show. I’ll have to decline but thank you.” 

This was music to Bonang’s fans and they couldn’t help but express how grateful there are for Queen B to take their advise. Bonang has previously stated that the return of her reality show Being Bonang for a second season was only because "she was giving her fans what they wanted".Read: 'Being Bonang season 2 is for the fans'
