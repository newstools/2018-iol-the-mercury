Durban - A Durban North homeowner is counting his lucky stars after escaping probable death during a robbery at his home on Tuesday. 
Five armed men stormed a home in Haleric Road, Durban North just after 7am. According to Marshall Security's Kyle van Reenen, the men gained access to the property by jumping over a boundary wall. AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
"Two of the five men were armed and they tried to smash through the front door when they were confronted by the homeowner. The man tried to fight off the suspects and a tussle ensued. The homeowner punched one of the suspects in the face before the armed men allegedly tried shooting the homeowner. Remarkably their weapons jammed preventing the shots from being discharged," van Reenen said. 
The gang then jumped back over the wall, got into their awaiting getaway vehicle and sped off - empty handed. 
Van Reenen said the homeowner was assessed at the scene by Crisis Medical paramedics. He declined to be taken to hospital. 
Police are investigating further, van Reenen added.
