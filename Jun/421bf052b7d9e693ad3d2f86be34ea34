Durban - KZN Women in Business (KZNWIB) is the longest-standing businesswomen’s networking association in KwaZulu Natal that acts as a support structure for women and a forum for fostering relationships, building networks, exchanging business knowledge and, ultimately assisting members to grow their businesses and in turn make a significant contribution to the economy, our city, and our province. As a non-profit organisation, KZNWIB donate all their profits to a charity that is nominated by their members each year.

KZNWIB Chairperson, Chrystal Austin, recently invited the organisation’s past chairladies to get together to plan and discuss the future of the organisation.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

"As a responsible women's networking organisation, we acknowledge the contributions that our past chairladies have made and endeavour to build on their achievements towards the continued success of KZN's longest-standing women’s networking organisation,” explained Chrystal.

Discussions were focussed around how to better recognise and support the women of KZN, from celebrating their achievements to acting as a voice for women’s issues and rights. These discussions incorporated plans to include the past leaders of the organisation to continue to contribute towards the future growth of the organisation.

"We have a vision of including the ‘giants’ of the past and connecting them to the future of KZNWIB and are in discussions to organise an advisory council made up of experienced leaders from different fields who will be able to guide, direct, support, encourage and teach women fundamental steps and principles to help them grow and develop their own businesses,” added Chrystal. 

The organisation has grown tremendously over the past few years and continues to grow in membership and following on major social media platforms.  KZNWIB offers monthly networking meetings as well as workshops which are open to its members as well as the public.
