Durban - A group of businessmen and their employees, including the leadership of the Delangokubona Business Forum, have threatened to dump loads of rubbish at the Moses Mabhida stadium if they do not get a meeting with eThekwini city manager Sipho Nzuza.

The group of about 40 people arrived at the stadium this morning in trucks and cars laden with refuse.

This was in protest against non-payment by Durban Solid Waste for refuse removal services in townships like Umlazi.

Most of the businessmen are sub-contracted to main contractors who have a waste removal contract with the city.

Since the beginning of the year, there have been at least three protests in Umlazi over the non-payment of subcontractors.

Nzuza was expected to be at the stadium as one of the panelists participating on the roundtable discussion on Brics.

Last week the city told The Mercury that it had paid contractors all work verified.  “Payment of sub-contractors appointed by the Main Contractors fall outside the scope of eThekwini. This is a relationship between the contractor and his subs,” Spokesperson Mandla Nsele said last week.

Police were keeping an eye on the situation.
