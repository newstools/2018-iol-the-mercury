“I would like to thank the Invest Durban team together with our provincial government and businesses for organising this important mission to London. It was a success as we had fruitful engagements which we believe will have positive results for the people of KwaZulu-Natal and eThekwini,” Gumede said.

She added that those those with capital to invest attended the meetings to hear more about Durban and KwaZulu-Natal.

Gumede said they were informed of the various catalytic projects underway in Durban as well as in local businesses and the region’s competitive advantages.

The delegation discussed a host of investor opportunities in Durban, including the Dube

Tradeport (the province’s flagship infrastructural development), Keystone Park (a logistics, warehousing and light industrial precinct), the Cornubia mixed-use development, the Richards Bay Industrial Development Zone (a prime industrial and trade hub), the Beachwood high-security premium residential location and five star resort as well as the Oceans Mall Development and Durban Point Waterfront.

Gumede said sporting business investments were also on offer via Amazulu Football Club, a Premier Soccer League Club based in Durban

“Moving forward, Invest Durban will be assisting businesses that met with the delegation abroad, as well as other businesses both local and international who did not, with any follow-up information required in the coming weeks. This increased bilateral trade and investment will be beneficial to all communities in both the UK and Durban,” Gumede said.
