Durban - We don't blame you if you're still reeling from the record high fuel price increase that took effect Wednesday morning.

Petrol now costs consumers 82 cents more a litre while diesel will set you back a further 85 cents.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
This will take the petrol price up to R15.54 and diesel will cost you R14.19.
According to eNCA the petrol retail price is regulated by the government and changed on the first Wednesday of every month
There are two factors that influence the price of petrol, namely  the price of the dollar vs the rand as well as the rising prices in crude oil, transport costs, and taxes and levies.
