They must discuss their organisation and not me because I have things to say about their organisation and themselves,” he said.Zuma is due to appear in the Durban High Court on Friday to face charges related to fraud, racketeering and money laundering did not mention the name of the organisation.The SACP at the weekend accused Zuma of being at the heart of a pushback against the ANC leadership and state captureSACP general-secretary Blade Nzimande said attempts to fight back the drive against corruption and state capture must not be underestimated, adding that they were linked to Zuma.“In many ways former president Zuma is at the heart of this counter-revolutionary fight-back, together with a circle of discredited individuals, many themselves facing the likelihood of criminal prosecution.SACP deputy general secretary Solly Mapaila accused the ANC of being soft on Zuma.Political Bureau
