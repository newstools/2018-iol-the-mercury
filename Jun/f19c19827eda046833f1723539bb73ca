Durban - Sixteen people, including officials from the Howick driver learner testing centre, were arrested for fraud and corruption following a sting at the centre in March. The group appeared briefly in the Durban Specialised Commercial Crimes Court on Wednesday. 

Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) spokesperson, Simon Zwane, said the 16, including licence examiners and learner licence applicants, were arrested by members Road Traffic Management Corporation’s National Traffic Anti-Corruption Unit and the Directorate of Priority Crime Investigations (Hawks) in a major crackdown on corruption related to the fraudulent issuing of motor vehicle driving licences earlier this year.

“The arrests followed a long investigation in which officials from the Howick driver learner testing centre were observed engaging in unethical and corrupt conduct at the centre,” he said. 

Zwane said investigations are continuing and more arrests are expected.

“Corruption related to the issuing of driving licence documents is a major concern and is believed to contribute significantly to road accidents in South Africa. A majority of fatal crashes  in South Africa are attributed to human error and the ability of the driver’s to handle the vehicle, plays an important role in this,” Zwane said. 

The group, currently out on bail, is due back in court on August 7.
