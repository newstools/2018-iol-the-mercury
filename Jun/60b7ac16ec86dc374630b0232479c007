Durban - A weekend fishing trip for a group of friends did not go quite as planned when their ski-boat suffered motor mechanical failure to both outboard motors two nautical miles off-shore of the Zimbali Coastal Resort.
On Saturday morning, the casualty boat had launched earlier in the day from Durban to go fishing.
The National Sea Rescue Institute's Craig Lambinon said as a precaution NSRI Durban duty crew were also placed on alert.

"Our NSRI Ballito duty crew towed our sea rescue craft SRU Rescue 1 and Remax Rescuer to the Salmon Bay launch site. The sea rescue craft SRU Rescue 1 was launched, with NSRI coxswains; Brendon Power and Chris Rawlings onboard, carrying some mechanical tools and carrying outboard boat motor spare parts with them, and they rendezvoused with the casualty boat finding the crew of the casualty boat safe and adrift at sea with both of the casualty craft outboard motors not operational," he said. AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
Lambinon added that Power and Rawlings assisted by the crew of the casualty boat and using the motor mechanical tools and the spare parts, they were able to mechanically repair the casualty boats motors at sea and once both motors were operational the casualty boat headed back to Durban.

"NSRI Ballito and NSRI Durban monitored the casualty boats progress and once the casualty boat was safely beached and recovered at their original launch site in Durban no further assistance was required," he said.
