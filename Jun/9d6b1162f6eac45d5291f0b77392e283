Gumede was speaking at a sitting of the city’s Executive Council on Tuesday. 

She said the report states that the collaboration between parties will be implemented with a focus on establishing lasting solutions and best practices on programmes associated with informal settlements upgrading with Shack Dwellers International Alliance and eThekwini Municipality. 
Deputy city manager of Human Settlements and Infrastructure, Beryl Mphakathi, said the Alliance consists of non-profit organisations who work closely with government.

“They are very progressive as they are developmental by nature. This MOA will ensure that we consolidate and have a set of principles we can deliver. We have been working with them for the past 10 years through different partnerships, this serves to consolidate the relationship,” she said.

Gumede explained that the MOA will assist the city immensely especially as a result of urbanisation.

“The MOA means that we will all be able to sit around a table with these organisations who will tell us what they want and we will tell them what our plans are. We will then be able to work together. This partnership will ensure service delivery in the city,” Gumede said.
