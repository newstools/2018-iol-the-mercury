Durban - The City of eThekwini's Security and Emergency Services Committee has given Metro Police the authority to engage the services of 110 summons servers. The Summons Servers will be engaged as private contractors and will receive a one year contract. It is proposed that they be paid R50 per summons personally served.

This was announced at the committee's monthly meeting on Wednesday. 

According to eThekwini Municipality’s Acting Head of Communications, Mandla Nsele, this arrangement will not only contribute towards job creation and poverty alleviation, it will also assist to improve revenue collection with regards to traffic fines.

"The committee was appraised of a R2 213 520 refund due to the Department of Justice. A report tabled indicated that between 2008 and 2015 the Durban Magistrates Court had erroneously paid bail monies to Council," Nsele said. 

He added that the Department of Justice alleges that R3 067 320 has been paid to the Municipality. 

"However, only R2 213 520 has been verified. The reimbursement will be made from the Metro Police suspense account," Nsele said. 

Also discussed at the meeting was the approval of the city's Disaster Management Level 2 Plan. 

"The plan is a strategic document that outlines disaster management principles and emergency response procedures to be applied by Council Departments in an event of a disaster or major incident," Nsele said. 

Reports tabled at the committee meeting will still be presented to city's Executive Committee (EXCO) and full council for final approval.
