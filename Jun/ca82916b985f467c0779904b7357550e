Moila, who is a hero in running circles, said she has never missed a SPAR Women’s Race, having completed all 10km races but one, about a decade ago, when the SPAR race was scheduled a week after Comrades, and she decided to opt for the shorter 5km race instead.

The two women will be lining up with other top-name runners from the province, competing in the SPAR Grand Prix, and along with them will be the remaining 17500 participants, tackling the 10km or the 5km scenic routes in what is being described as South Africa’s most beautiful race.
