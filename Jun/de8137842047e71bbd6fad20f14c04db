Durban - Inspired by Michelle Potgieter, a volunteer at a rhino sanctuary, Liz Wilson-Chandler, a specialist wound care nurse and team member of Gift of the Givers, intervened with her amazing wound care skills to assist Arthur, a four-week old baby rhino who was severely hacked with a machete when defending his mother against poachers. The mother died.

Arthur was physically, emotionally and psychologically traumatised. It is understood that baby rhino's die more commonly from emotional trauma rather than wounds especially when they are separated from their mother. Arthur required tender loving care, a gentle touch and an expert wound specialist to nurse him to health in a safe, secret and private rehabilitation environment. Liz has treated many animals over the years.

Gift of the Givers is supporting this project of rhino healing. Michelle's initiative to help one rhino has had an amazing reaction. Wound dressings and medical supplies have poured in from BSN, Ligamed, Electrospyres, Acetily, Umzinzi Health and Safarnex. We thank these companies. Surplus stock can now be used to assist rhinos in various sanctuaries throughout South Africa. Calls for assistance have been received as far afield as Namibia.



Those wanting to support the project and those requiring assistance for traumatised rhinos can contact Michelle Potgieter 0767853437 or Liz Wilson-Chandler 0832590257. All stock will be warehoused at Gift of the Givers Logistics Centre in Bramley, Johannesburg.
