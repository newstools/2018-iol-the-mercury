Cape Town - The National Freedom Party (NFP) has slammed the "sickening behaviour" of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema and Congress of the People (Cope) leader Mosiuoa Lekota during the public hearing held in Limpopo on amendment of Section 25 of the Constitution. AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by TeadsAccording to reports, the confrontation started when Lekota allegedly said something that angered Malema. Malema then started waving his finger in the Cope leader's face, prompting Lekota to stand up and walk away."It is unnecessary for leaders to become uncontrollable and disastrous on a platform which is set to listen to the public views on the serious issue of land. They have shown South Africans that they need education when it comes to political tolerance and when it comes to public representative conduct," the NFP said in a statement, strongly condemning their "childish behaviour"."Mr Malema and Mr Lekota must be treated as patients who are suffering from anger disorder, they must be encouraged to seek for professional help as this poses danger to our democracy," said NFP spokesperson Sabelo Sigudu.Malema and Lekota are on opposites sides of the land debate. Lekota has remained defiant about his views on land, saying that land expropriation without compensation will take the country “back to war”. He also said that the EFF's ideas around land expropriation without compensation were dangerous.On the other hand, Malema has reiterated his call for expropriation of land without compensation. "Unemployment in South Africa is as a result of lack of land, and racism is because of land." "They have no respect for people without property. We are fighting for your dignity so you can walk around as a dignified person," Malema said.IOL
