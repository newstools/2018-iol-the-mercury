Durban - July fever spread across Greyville Racecourse on Thursday morning as racing fans and fashionistas converged for the annual Vodacom Durban July Gallops.

Overcast skies kept the wintery temperatures at bay as the racing fans watched thirteen of the eighteen thoroughbreds named in the Vodacom Durban July final field being put through their paces from the 800 metre mark, riding in pairs or with stable mates.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads



The five runners not available for the Gallops were filmed earlier in the week in Gauteng and their gallops were played on the massive big screen at Greyville Racecourse and then dissected by the panel of television analysts.



Just as fascinating for the crowd that turned out to watch the form of the July runners and enjoy the free coffee and sticky buns were the ten models wearing outfits from the Vodacom Durban July Fashion Experience programme, giving punters tips on what to wear on the big race day.



Infield, the construction of the thirty marquees that make up the legendary hospitality village is well under way, and should be completed by the weekend.



Ticket sales through Computicket are now brisk, and another full house is expected at Greyville Racecourse next Saturday.
