Durban - The case Phoenix mother who was captured allegedly beating her 4-year-old daughter has been postponed until August.  

The 25-year-old woman appeared at the Verulam Magistrates Court on Thursday with her then boyfriend, who is a co-accused in the attempted murder of the child.  

He allegedly captured the abuse  on video,  which went viral on social media. 

Represented by separate private attorneys, the pair stood at opposite ends of the dock. 

The state prosecutor asked the court for the remand as a psychologist's report was still outstanding. This as the child was still having sessions with a psychologist. AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

Background

In March, the video emerged of the mother assaulting her child. The mother initially reported that it was the boyfriend who was abusing the child and was by the little girl’s side in hospital. However, police later confirmed that the mother had also been arrested and the pair charged with culpable homicide.

The couple was granted R3 000 bail each but the boyfriend later handed himself back over to police after a car, reportedly belonging to his parents, was burned by an angry mob outside his home.

The couple, who cannot be named to protect the identity of the 4-year-old child, was arrested after the video was anonymously brought to the attention of Alvin Brijlal, founder of the Victims Outreach Information Centre (Voice), who reported the abuse to police.
