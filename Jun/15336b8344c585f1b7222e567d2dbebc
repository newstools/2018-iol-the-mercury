Durban - Plans to rob a home and leave with the loot went awry for two would-be robbers after one was shot in Effingham, Durban, this week. 
Earlier this week, a Marshall Security officer who was conducting patrols in the area, was notified about two men entering a home in Bailey Road. 
Marshall Security spokesperson, Kyle van Reenen, said whilst conducting an external check of the property, the reaction officer was confronted by two suspects, one of whom assaulted him with a bucket causing him to fall to the ground.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

"The second suspect armed with a crowbar, began approaching the officer threatening to kill him. The armed reaction officer drew his firearm firing a shot to defend his life. The suspect was struck in the leg and fell to the ground. His accomplice fled on foot and managed to evade arrest. The suspect was attended to by Crisis Medical paramedics and taken under police guard to a nearby medical facility for further care," van Reenen said. 
He added that upon further investigations at the house, it was found that the men had forced entry into the house by breaking a window. 
Police are investigating further.
