In a letter written to Premier Willies Mchunu, Mncwango said the Premier should institute a comprehensive investigation in the claims.

The first one relates to a R7.7 million tender awarded to Ncube’s company, Brand Partners, by the Nkandla municipality.

“The appointment was in contravention of SCM procedure while using the Regulation 32 and it was not budgeted for,” Mncwango said.

The contract was for the provision of communication services to the municipality over a period of 36 months.

The DA says the municipality was supposed to have obtained approval from the Provincial Treasury but it had not done so.

Brand Partners also received “a series of contracts for communication and other related services worth R8.2 million” from the Mthonjaneni municipality.

The DA claims that the municipal managers at both municipalities, who authorised the contracts had been appointed despite not meeting the requirements for their position.

The DA has given the Premier seven days to respond to its call for an investigation.

MEC Dube-Ncube is expected to respond to the claims at a press conference to be held later today in Pietermaritzburg. Her office has already said that these claims are coordinated to coincide with the ANC’s provincial conference which starts on Friday.

Dube-Ncube is the provincial treasurer of the party and is expected to contest one of the top five positions at the conference.

The DA denied claims that its “expose” has anything to do with the upcoming conference.
