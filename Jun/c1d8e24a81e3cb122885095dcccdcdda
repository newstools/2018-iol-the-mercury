Durban - The Department of International Relations and Cooperation (Dirco) is hard at work trying to secure the release of the passports of 51 students, stuck in the Republic of China, who were duped in a visa scam. 

In a statement, Dirco said the students were told that they would get their work visas once they arrived in China but that never happened. 

While in China on study visas, they started working which was in contravention of the immigration laws of the Republic of China. 

Dirco minister, Lindiwe Sisulu, has instructed her department to work with the Chinese authorities to have their passports released so that they can come back to South Africa as soon as possible.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

Sisulu said according to SA Embassy in Beijing, the students were enticed by an agent to travel to China on a study visa while planning to work as English teachers. 

“Our Embassy in Beijing is liaising with the Chinese authorities in addressing this matter. We are also in touch with the Chinese Ambassador to South Africa to have their passports released. The Chinese Ambassador to South Africa has made an undertaking that he will expedite the matter,” she said. Sisulu said they were aware that the Chinese authorities will follow their own legal processes.

“We appeal to all South Africans to be cautious of these scams and to check with the relevant authorities before travelling to other countries. DIRCO will continue to provide consular assistance to those South Africans in distress and also to keep those affected families informed of the latest developments”, Sisulu said. 

She added that she would engage with the ministers of Police and Home Affairs about such scams so those responsible are taken to task. 

Sisulu said for now, the focus is on bringing the students back home.
