Durban - At least 20 crates of sardines were netted off the backline on the KwaZulu-Natal south coast on Tuesday morning. The KZN Sharks Board has been monitoring activity over the last two weeks and noted reports of fish being netted between Ifafa and Mtwalume. 

KZNSB Operations Manager, Greg Thompson, said on Tuesday morning, there were reports of sardines rising behind the backline from Scottburgh to Mtwalume.

"Some of the Commercial Sein Netters did launch their craft to net but the only successful net was a small one of 20 crates at Elysium beach," he said. 

Thompson said there had been reports of large pods of dolphins moving north past Port Edward. 

"Reports from Port Saint Johns is that the dive boats had some good sardine bait balls this morning with hundreds of common dolphin seen feeding in that area," he added. AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

Thompson said shark safety gear had been removed from all protected beaches from Anstey’s on the Bluff to Port Edward on the South Coast. 

"Some netting has been replaced along the Durban beachfront as the sardine movement seems to be bypassing this area for now and Bathing has been re-opened at the Bay of Plenty, North, South and New Beach," Thompson said. 

The Sharks Board appeals to members of the public to exercise caution should they enter the water during this time. 

"The Board will continue to monitor the movement of the shoals and will manage the shark safety gear in consultation with the coastal municipalities that are affected," he said.
