Durban - The eThekwini municipality is set to increase security at all the city’s electricity substations, to prevent these being sabotaged should Eskom workers go on strike this week.
Speaking during the city's Executive Council meeting on Tuesday, Mayor Zandile Gumede, said she has instructed senior managers to ensure that substations and other electricity infrastructure remains secured until the strike is over.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

“Please make sure that security is there. We do not want our substations to be blown up. Make sure they are secured until the strike is over," the mayor said. 

Gumede's announcement was made after councillor Mondli Mthembu told Exco that the city had been informed of the Eskom strike and that it could affect the operations at the city.

It was reported this morning that some unions were planning to strike on Thursday if their demands for wage increases are not met.
Meanwhile, Eskom released a statement earlier in the day stating that workers could go on strike after they announced that they would not be able to offer salary increases. 

According to Eskom, this was due to their current financial situation.

"Eskom has noted the statements made by the trade unions about their intentions to embark on an industrial action this Thursday. Eskom has been designated as an essential service provider, and therefore our employees are reminded that they are not allowed to participate in strike actions. In an effort to ensure security of power supply, Eskom will activate its contingency measures should the industrial action take place," the statement read.
