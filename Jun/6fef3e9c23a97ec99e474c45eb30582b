Durban - Eskom has warned of load shedding to continue for most of Sunday as they battle with constrained resources.

The power giant has said, despite several units being returned to service, the risk of load shedding remains. 

In a statement issued to the media on Sunday morning, Eskom said the constraints follow on from the effects of the recent industrial action and will remain so in the coming week.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

According to the statement, some employees continue to work around the clock to restore stability to operations and supply. 

“We assure customers that all available emergency energy resources are used, before load shedding is implemented. We would like to apologise but equally thank our customers who are helping us to improve, by reporting variations in Eskom’s load shedding schedules. As a result these schedules are being revised,” the statement read. 

Eskom encouraged residents and businesses to continue using electricity sparingly. 

Please switch off geysers during the day especially during peak periods; 7am  - 10am and 6pm - 9pm, as well as all non-essential lighting and electricity appliances to assist in reducing demand. 

Remember to treat all electrical points as live during a power outage.

Customers are advised to keep checking their load shedding schedules on the Eskom and their municipal website, and plan on the assumption that load shedding will take place.
Meanwhile, readers of The Mercury have commented on how they are dealing with the power outages.
