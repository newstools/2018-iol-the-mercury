Durban - Eskom has said there is a lower probability of rotational load shedding on Wednesday, however it could change due to an increase in electricity demands during the 5pm - 9pm peak period. 
The utility giant said should rotational load shedding be implemented, it would be for a period up to four hours. 
In a media statement issued, Eskom said they will advise if rotational load shedding will be conducted in either stage 1, stage 2, stage 3 or stage 4, dependent on the capacity shortage.  AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
"Stage 1 requires 1000MW to be rotationally load shed nation-wide,  stage 2 requires 2000 MW , stage 3 requires 3000 MW and stage 4 calls for up to 4000 MW to be rotationally load shed nationally in that given period.  Load shedding is conducted as a measure of last resort to protect the power system from a total collapse or blackout," the statement said. 
Meanwhile, 34% of The Mercury's Twitter followers are unaware that load shedding has been taking place in parts of the country, for at least a second week now. 
 In the poll, The Mercury asked followers how were they occupying themselves when the lights went out. 


In the event that load shedding becomes necessary, Eskom and the municipalities will use load shed according to the published loadshedding schedules. For Eskom customers, these schedules are available on the Eskom website (loadshedding.eskom.co.za). Eskom customers can also contact our customer contact centre at 0860 037 566.
