Durban - More than 100 people, including police officers, were arrested following a sting at the police living quarters at the Durban Central Police Station on Friday morning.  

Police spokesperson, Brigadier Jay Naicker, said in total 115 people were arrested, some of whom included police officers that should not be in those buildings. 

“All the arrested suspects were charged for trespassing and given a fine. A further two dockets of corruption were opened after police established that some people were renting out rooms in these buildings to other occupants,” he said. AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

Naicker explained that the illegal occupation or hijacking of buildings has become very common in the country. 



“This disturbing trend has resulted into many buildings being occupied without basic necessities such as water, lights or proper sanitation. Over and above that these hijacked buildings become a hub for criminal activity. The South African Police Service assisted by other relevant role players are charged with the responsibility of making sure that these buildings which have become a haven for criminals are dealt with effectively and that the perpetrators are brought to book,” he said.

Naicker said it had become apparent over some time that residences which were built to house our police officials have been illegally accommodating people who do not work for the South African Police Service. 

KZN  Acting Provincial Commissioner, Lieutenant General Mkhwanazi, said overtime the buildings had dilapidated and were not fit for human habitation. 



“The fact that people are on our police premises illegally also poses a risk to the police officers that work from these places,” he said.
