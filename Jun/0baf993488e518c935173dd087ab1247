"Paramedics from the KwaZulu-Natal Department of Health’s Emergency Medical Services were a part of the emergency teams that responded. We found that a woman and her daughter had sustained fatal injuries during the roof collapse. It is believed that the two victims were the only people in the house at the time," he said. 
Mckenzie extended his condolences to the woman's family and friends. 
He said police were called out to the scene and would be investigating further.
