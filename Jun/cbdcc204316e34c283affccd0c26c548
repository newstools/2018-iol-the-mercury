Durban - The pilot of a light aircraft was in critical condition in hospital after crashing in a farm in the Dargle Valley in the KZN Midlands on Monday .
The man, who ER24 said was believed to be in his 40s, was trapped in the mangled remains of the light aircraft when paramedics arrived just before noon. 

Emergency Medical Services (EMS) spokesperson Robert Mckenzie said the man crashed into a hill on a farm near the town of Dargle.

“Paramedics and rescuers, assisted by local farmers, had to climb down the steep and rocky hill to access the aircraft. Paramedics worked together to treat the critically injured pilot of the single-seat aircraft,” he said. AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

The Jaws of Life had to be used to free the man from the wreckage. 

IPSS Medical Rescue’s Paul Herbst said the man was stabilised at the scene and airlifted by IPSS to hospital. 

Mckenzie said the circumstances resulting in the plane crashing were not known, and would be investigated by authorities.

Meanwhile, the search for Newcastle mining engineer Johan Fourie, 61, whose plane was last picked up over the Indian Ocean, has been suspended. 

Aeronautical Search and Rescue Co-ordination Centre chief Santjie White said they had no choice but to suspend the search as the chances of survival for a pilot who was assumed to have crashed into the sea without a marine-equipped plane were slim. 

However, she said the search would resume if new information came to light.
