Durban -  A water relief project, initiated in the Nongoma and Abaqulusi municipalities, in northern KwaZulu-Natal is providing tap water to more than 6000 residents.

Mhlathuze Water’s Siyabonga Maphumulo said the project is spearheaded by Mhlathuze Water on behalf of the Department of Water and Sanitation to install water supply infrastructure to communities residing under the Zululand District.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

This week, Mhlathuze Water Interim CEO, Mthokozisi Duze visited the area where he got a first-hand account on progress made thus far on the project. He was pleased to be a part of the writing of a new chapter in the lives of the largely rural communities.

“The ongoing project has already brought relief to thousands of households and created job opportunities. We are extremely elated that finally people who had never before had convenient access to safe drinking water at the turn of a tap are finally able to do so. This project to supply water to the communities of Nongoma and Abaqulusi is ongoing our goal is to ultimately see everyone effortlessly accessing this precious liquid,” he said.

The R96-million project has thus far resulted in more than 6000 households receiving tap water and has helped create some 200 jobs during its implementation phase.

Anne Myeni, a local resident, said; “We feel like we have received manna from heaven. Our problems are finally over."

For people like Myeni, who previously had to queue for the arrival of a water tanker or make early morning treks to the river to draw water before it became cloudy and muddy due to cows helping themselves to it, the project offers reprieve from a challenge that had become the bane of their lives.
