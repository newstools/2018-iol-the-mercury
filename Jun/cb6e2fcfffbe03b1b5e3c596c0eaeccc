Durban - Five people were treated for injured sustained in a two-car crash on the N3, in Cato Ridge, on Sunday night. ER24 spokesperson, Russel Meiring, said ER24 paramedics, along with other services, arrived on the scene at 18h30 to find the two vehicles in the left-hand lane of the highway.

"Upon assessment, paramedics discovered that one woman had sustained serious injuries while four others, including two children, had sustained minor to moderate injuries. Paramedics treated the patients and provided the seriously injured woman with pain-relief medication," he said. AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
Meiring said once treated, ER24 transported the patients to Mediclinic Pietermaritzburg for further treatment.

In a second crash earlier in the day, two people were killed and a third injured when the car they were travelling in crashed into a tree off the N3 near the Wartburg turnoff in Umshwathi, KwaZulu Natal.
Meiring said ER24 paramedics, along with other services, arrived on the scene at the scene to find a vehicle at the bottom of a small embankment. 
"One patient was found walking around on the scene while the body of a woman was found lying a few metres away from the vehicle. A man was found lying inside the vehicle. Paramedics assessed the patients and found that the woman lying outside the vehicle and the man lying inside had already succumbed to their numerous injuries. Nothing more could be done for them and they were declared dead," he said. 

The third patient was assessed and found to have sustained moderate injuries. He was treated and transported to a nearby hospital for further treatment.

Local authorities were on the scene for further investigations for both crashes.
