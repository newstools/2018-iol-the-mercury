Durban - Visvin Reddy, is calling on the public to support the #FuelPricesMustFall campaign following two major price hikes in recent week.
He said on July 2, he is hoping to be joined by the masses to speak out about the increasing price of petrol in SA.
Reddy said they are hoping that on July 2, all drivers would shut down the city's highways, freeways and main roads from 7am - 8am simply by switching their cars off.  
"Our fuel prices will be going up again. There will be no consultation and it will be done overnight. Enough is enough. Food and transport costs are going up and soon more South Africans will be living in poverty, than ever before," he said. 
"We need to now intensify our campaign and make a bigger impact.The only protests that get the attention of authorities these days are the violent ones, where tyres are burns and main roads blockaded. I'm not suggesting we do this but a  more acceptable means of protest that will have the desired effect, is to stop all vehicles wherever we are, at a given time. This will bring the entire country to a complete standstill. We begin with just 10 minutes and hand a memorandum to the President with 100 000 signatures. If the fuel prices are not brought down we will hold a second #vehiclestandstill but this time 20 minutes," Reddy said.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

Reddy's videos, posted on his social media, have already been viewed and shared hundreds of times. 
He said this is not about politics but fighting for the poorest of the poor. He added that although the planned demonstration had received positive feedback, there were those trying to cause trouble. 
"We are not here to gain fame or gain glory to get a place in Parliament. We have a genuine concern for the impact that the fuel hikes are having. We know there are some bad elements trying to sow discord but we stand against that," he said.
