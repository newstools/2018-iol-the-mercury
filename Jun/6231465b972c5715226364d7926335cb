Durban - A woman was rushed to hospital in a critical condition after her car crashed into a concrete barrier and burst into flames on Saturday morning. 

The woman was driving at the intersection of Randles Road and Stanley Copley Drive around 3am, when her car crashed into a robot and then a concrete barrier.
