DURBAN - While the music blasted at the Albert Park in Durban for the night vigil ahead of former president Jacob Zuma’s court appearance, a frail, elderly woman sat quietly under a tree.Beauty "MaSkhakhane" Shezi, 73, travelled from Zuma’s village in Nkandla and had with her just two small bags and a large ANC throw to brave the cold Durban weather overnight.Braving chilly weather of 16 degrees Celsius, she arrived in Durban by minibus taxi with a group of Zuma supporters on Thursday morning, and slept under a tree at the park as they had no place to sleep. Shezi said she would only go back home after the former president appears at the Durban High Court on Friday.“I took a taxi with other people from the village. Some have relatives around Durban but I just decided to come straight here because I know the (Albert) park,” she said.Shezi spoke fondly of Zuma, and referred to him as Msholozi.
