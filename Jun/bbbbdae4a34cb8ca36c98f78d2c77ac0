Police spokesperson, Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane said officers noticed a silver C Class Mercedez Benz and radioed in the registration plate details on the car. 

"The information that came back was that the registration plates did not belong to the car," he said. 


Zwane said the officers proceeded to check and search the car. Three men were seated inside the car. Officers found two unlicensed firearms with the serial numbers filed off. The car also came up positive on a Sydenham CAS of hijacking which occurred last year," Zwane said. 

He added that the three men, aged between 32 and 34 were arrested for possession of unlicensed firearm and possession of ammunition and fraud. They will also be linked to other cases, including the business robbery which occurred at the Durban north bank last week.

Zwane said that the men were detained at the Durban North police station. 

Meanwhile, earlier in the day three men appeared in the Kranskop Magistrates Court on charges of possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition. They were arrested on Thursday by members of the Umzinyathi Cluster task team and Crime Intelligence unit.
