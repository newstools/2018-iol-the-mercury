Durban - The northern Natal town of Dundee will resound with hooves pounding the racetrack and the frenzied shouts of excited crowds as horses and jockeys race to the finish line when the annual rural race meeting comes to town.

The event, which always takes place towards the end of July, is one of three events that make July in KwaZulu-Natal an important horse racing month. Dundee is the venue of choice as it has a newly installed race track and is well positioned inland allowing for access by the majority of race participants.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

Rural horse owners and jockeys from KwaZulu-Natal, Eastern Cape, Free State, Mpumalanga, Gauteng and Lesotho will compete against each other for the winner’s title and stake money.

When it started in 2005 there were 30 participants and 1500 spectators. Each year since then the Dundee July has seen phenomenal growth in the number of race-goers.

This year a crowd of around 20 000 horse racing enthusiasts are expected to converge on Dundee for the 2018 festivities which start on Thursday 19 July in a two-day build-up to the big race day on Saturday July 21. This is not to be missed and includes two high profile international races; a ladies event and a choreographed fashion show.

This rural horse tripling (bareback trotting) race event is the second KZN Department of Sport and Recreation flagship event run in collaboration with the Endumeni and UMzinyathi District municipalities. Most districts within KZN participate and this year over 320 horse owners and 200 Jockeys are expected in to compete in eight events.
