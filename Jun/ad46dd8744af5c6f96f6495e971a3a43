It will take up to two years to rebuild the Edith Benson Babies’ Home, which was gutted by a fire in February.
This, as the board wants to create a world-class facility for babies who are placed in their care in terms of court orders. 

Child Welfare Durban and district president Rajan Pillay said that in the meantime, they had made space for 25 children in two cottages at the William Clark Gardens Othandweni Child and Youth Care Centre, which is on the same property as Edith Benson.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

After the fire, the 55 children - aged between 3 months and 5 years old - were taken to four different homes with their caregivers. 

Pillay said the investigators had said it was evident from the burn pattern that the fire was caused by an electrical wiring problem.

The fire - which was noticed by one of the children - had spread quickly due to the building’s age. 

“Its over 60 years old, so the rafters were really dry, allowing the fire to spread quickly,” said Pillay. 

He said  that while the property was insured, a payout was preferred to a like-for-like rebuild of the home. 

“The board is looking at getting in specialists with experience in building world-class children’s homes. 

“We try to provide an environment as you would get in your home, to make it so that the children have everything they would experience if they were at home with family,” said Pillay. 

Several companies and professionals had expressed an interest in getting involved with the project, which the board wanted to to be world-class in terms of the safety standards, layout and aesthetics, he said. 

This would include fireproof mattresses, as per the Department of Social Development’s norms and standards. 

“We are very close to finalising everything, but the build will take between 18 to 24 months to be ready for the ­babies to move back,” said ­Pillay.
