Durban - Truck drivers are demanding that officials from the departments of Home Affairs and Labour address the ongoing issues plaguing the industry. On Wednesday morning, truckers blocked off the N3 at Van Reenen's Pass in both directions. 

Social media reports from trucking companies suggest the protests are a result of South African truckers being angry about the employment of foreign drivers in the industry.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

It's been reported that around 100 trucks had parked off on the roadway between Harrismith and the Tugela Toll Plaza / Ladysmith with seemingly no intention of moving.

Officials from the uMkhanyakude district arrived at the scene but left without speaking to drivers.
