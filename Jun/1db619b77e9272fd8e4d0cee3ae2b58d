They then instructed the deceased to go to the office where they demanded the keys to the safe and that he must unlock the door".The suspects then proceeded to rob Zetler of his property before stabbing him andÂ fleeing the scene.Â Paramedics arrived at the scene shortly after 4.30pm,Â where they found a member of a security company performing CPR on Zetler."Paramedics found that the man was stabbed with an unknown object in his chest.
