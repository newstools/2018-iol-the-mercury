The man accused of murdering Siam Lee is being transferred to Westville Prison.

The 29-year-old, who cannot be identified due to a rape charge that was recently levelled against him, previously told the court his family had been harassed when they visited him at the Durban North police station, where he was being held, and that he feared for his life.

He claimed he had been tortured, suffocated “with plastic,” and punched, and pleaded to be transferred.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
Breakthrough arrest in #SiamLee case

He made a brief appearance in the Durban magistrate’s court on Tuesday morning, when magistrate Mahomed Motala said, “You’ll be relieved to hear you’re being transferred to Westville”.

He laughed briefly in response.

Lee, 20, disappeared from her workplace - an alleged brothel - in Margaret Maytom Drive, in plush Durban North, on the afternoon of January 4.

Her burnt remains were found days later, in a sugarcane field, in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands.

The man police believe killed her, was arrested last month.

He now faces a raft of charges related to Lee’s death as well as other incidents.

He is due to apply for bail next month.
