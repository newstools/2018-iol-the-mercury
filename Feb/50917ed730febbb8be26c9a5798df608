We want to return to work, to do what were employed to do,” said Mbatha.Milton Estrice, chairperson of the Crisis Committee for staff, said: “The university has not been willing to negotiate. DUT workers' salaries docked“We’ve lowered our demands in an effort to meet them at a lower percentage, but Vice-Chancellor Thandwa Mthembu made it clear very early in the talks that he was not willing to negotiate. His offer was final from the word go.”On February 20, the university implemented the “no work, no pay” principle.Alan Khan, Senior Director of Corporate Affairs at the university, said: “DUT implemented the ‘No work no pay’ principle, as per the Labour Relations Act, No 66 of 1995 .
