KwaZulu-Natal has produced its first nuclear physician, Dr Alphonse Msomi who hopes his achievement will encourage others to pursue the field. 

Msomi completed his registrar training in nuclear medicine at Albert Luthuli Hospital in November last year, and recently graduated, becoming the first to be trained in the province.

“(It is) amazing feeling. It’s something that brought pride to my family. I hope this achievement will encourage more young people in the province to pursue a similar career path,” he said.

While there are nuclear physicians working in KZN, they were trained elsewhere in the country and Msomi hopes that his achievement will draw special attention to the discipline.

Msomi graduated with a Fellowship of the College of Nuclear Physicians of South Africa (FCNPSA) from The Colleges of Medicine of South Africa.

The 31-year-old completed his matric at Bechet Secondary School in 2004 and his MBChB degree at the University of KwaZulu-Natal’s Nelson R Mandela Medical School in 2009.  He did his internship at Prince Mshiyeni Memorial Hospital in Umlazi and in 2012 completed his community service at the Church of Scotland Hospital in Msinga.

After some work in private practices he worked at Osindisweni Hospital in Verulam and later began the registrar training programme in nuclear medicine.

Msomi said his journey in medicine was greatly influenced by his nurse mother and family.
