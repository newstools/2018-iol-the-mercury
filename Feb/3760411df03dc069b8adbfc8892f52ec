A fire at a rural school on the KwaZulu-Natal South Coast has razed several buildings to the ground.

Spokesperson for the provincial Department of Basic Education Kwazi Mthethwa said on Sunday that Fundinduku High School, in Umbumbulu, caught on fire on Friday night.

“The administration block and two classrooms were burnt to ashes,” Mthethwa said.

While the cause of the blaze had not yet been identified, Mthethwa said his offices condemned the incident as a bid at “crippling” the province’s education system of education.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

“We call upon anyone who might have information that could lead to the prosecution of the perpetrators to immediately approach the police,” he said, “We will not tolerate thuggery and hooliganism in our schools”.

The matter was reported to police, Mthethwa said.

But, said police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane, no case was opened.

Mthethwa said the department would visit the school on Monday to try and establish what had happened.
