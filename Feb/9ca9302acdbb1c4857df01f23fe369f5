It was a three-year-old who raised the alarm after seeing smoke, leading to the successful evacuation of 55 infants and toddlers from a fire which gutted a Durban children’s home. 


The blaze ravaged the Edith Benson Children's Home in Sherwood for more than two hours on Tuesday night, with firefighters battling it until just after 11pm. 
There was still smoke rising from the from the rubble when social development MEC Weziwe Thusi visited the home on Wednesday morning.


She said the child who saw the smoke told one of the 12 caregivers who were on duty. They were then able to evacuate all the children who are aged between 3-months and 5-years-old. 

“All the children are safe, and all the child and youth care workers are safe, one of them suffered smoke inhalation but she is fine now,” said Thusi. 

The cause of the fire is still under investigation.
