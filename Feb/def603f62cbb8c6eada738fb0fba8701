Durban - A picture of an ANC councillor from the Inkosi Langalibalele Municipality in Estcourt “eating a stack of money” has sparked calls for the municpality's councillors to be subjected to lifestyle audits.
In the picture, ANC councillor Siboniso Ndwandwe is seen taking a bite out of a stack of R200 notes with stacks of R100 notes and R200 notes around him.
Sources told The Mercury that the picture had been the subject of discussions within the ANC social media groups for the past two weeks.
Contacted for comment on Monday, Ndwandwe said he knew about the picture but he did not want to entertain the matter. ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
“I have heard of such a picture but I would not want to get too deeply into that matter. I do not run the municipality and I have a right to live my life. The complaints are just the work of the opposition.” 
The municipality was recently placed under administration by the provincial department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta).

IFP councillor Mthandeni Majola said they wanted an investigation into the lifestyle of the  councillors.

“We challenge the MEC for Cogta (Nomsa Dube) and the MEC for Safety ( Thomas Kaunda) to establish a forensic investigation into to all councillors of INkosi Langalibalele and lifestyle audits.
