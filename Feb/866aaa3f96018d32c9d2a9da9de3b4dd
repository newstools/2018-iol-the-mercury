Cancer patients in KwaZulu-Natal have been thrown a lifeline with the appointment of a team of specialists whose work is expected to decrease treatment waiting time.

Health MEC Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo introduced the successful oncology service providers from the Wits Health Consortium at a briefing at the Inkosi Albert Luthuli Central Hospital (IALCH) on Thursday.

The Consortium will send three oncologists to treat patients at the hospital five days a week. This will mean 150 new and 300 follow up cancer patients can be seen at IALCH a month, said Dhlomo.

Last year, the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) released a damning report on the oncology crisis in the province. One of the findings was that patients had to wait as long as eight months for treatment. It was not known how many people died waiting for treatment.

But, with the new team coming on board, waiting time was expected to decrease to between six and eight weeks. 

At the briefing were project manager Sipho Majola, Dr Itumeleng Funani, the Chief Academic and Clinical Officer at the Consortium which is an entity of the University of the Witwatersrand. The university's Assistance Dean of Strategic Affairs, Dr Weziwe Chitha was also present as well as oncologist leading the team of specialists, Dr Victor Litlhakanyane. 


They will be treating patients at IALCH on the three machines which are fully functional.  This would complement the the work of the four oncologists at Grey’s Hospital in Pietermaritzburg, who treated patients on one machine. People in northern KZN were treated  at a satellite site and the two machines at Addington expected to be up and running by April. 

With all this, the province is expected to see at least 365 new cancer patients and follow up on 1400 every month, said Dhlomo.
