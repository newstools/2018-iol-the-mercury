They have come to share that we must engage with the Ingonyama Trust about land. I am happy that Judge Ngwenya (Jerome) showed us that this is not a question of state land. This is the question of what is right, (about) the land that has been here, and we must discuss justice in that issue,” Maimane said.Of his visit with the king, Maimane said: “Today we shared many things including that we need to see development in rural communities. We need to ensure that young South Africans also have opportunities to get a decent education in rural communities.“I share the king’s commitment to development, not only of industry but of human capital. Our greatest assets are our people, and the people who reside in this province.”The Ingonyama Trust issue has come under the spotlight recently following recommendations for the scrapping of the trust of which the king is the sole trustee. The recommendations, which were made by a panel that was chaired by former president Kgalema Motlanthe, have angered the Zulu king.Yesterday he again warned that any attempt to scrap the Ingonyama Trust Act would provoke the Zulu nation, and that he and his subjects would vigorously oppose such a move.“If there is someone who wants to take land from us we will defend it,” he said.The king said the abolishment of the trust would lead to the land being expropriated from him without compensation.“I wish to once again place it on record that it is not in the interests of this country that Africans, in particular the Zulu people, be the subject of provocation by those in power.“I plead for honest engagement on this rather thorny issue, and the sooner this is done the better,” he said.The king said he was also opposed to the expropriation of land, which traditional leaders across the country had acquired through homelands during apartheid.The DA’s leader Mmusi Maimane gave Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini a gift of five cows during his visit on Sunday.

The visit was also seen as part of the DA’s drive to grow its support in rural parts of KZN.Zulu king: Hands off our land“We will be engaging all the stakeholders including amakhosi and we felt that before we even go to amakhosi, we should start with the king who presides over them,” Mncwango added.The king said it was the first time that the DA had come to introduce its leaders to him. “It is a blessing to me that most political parties are making sure that they introduce themselves. Therefore I wish that you, Mr Maimane you feel accepted because this is a home for everyone.”The king called on Maimane to make sure that he raised important matters in Parliament.“We want an opposition party that raise issues without fear to be given a chance to govern, and to ensure that it treats all our people equally and with dignity.“It should not shy away from addressing historical issues that require answers after 23 years of democracy,” said the king.The king said even though he did not want to interfere in party politics that “South Africans deserve better from both the ruling party and opposition,” he said.In his report, Motlanthe alleged that the Ingonyama Trust Act secretly entered into a deal with IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi and former president FW De Klerk days before the first democratic election in 1994.He further alleged that the existence of the trust perpetuated tribalism in the country.But Buthelezi has rejected Motlanthe’s claim.Although FW De Klerk Foundation had denied that the Act was passed secretly, he said it was passed to encourage the IFP to participate in the elections.The Mercury
