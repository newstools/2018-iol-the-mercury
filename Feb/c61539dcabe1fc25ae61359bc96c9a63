She was assaulted with the butt of a gun. Â 

Fortunately, she was abandoned by the hijackers after the vehicle suffered a blowout and stopped on the embankment adjacent to the M4 Ruth First Highway. 

They then fled on foot into the nearby bushes, taking with them a bag with a large amount of money. 

An extensive search by Marshal, police and Metro police K9 unit yielded no results. 

Although severely traumatised, the woman declined to be transported to hospital after she was assessed by Crisis Medical Emergency Services.
