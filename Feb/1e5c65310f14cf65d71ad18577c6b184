The boyfriend of a northern KwaZulu-Natal policewoman has been arrested for her murder, after charred remains were found in a burned vehicle.

Constable Senzeni Msipha, 33, disappeared on January 30. She had left her home in Maqhakaza area, Gingindlovu north of the province to go shopping at a local mall in her Ford Fiesta. 

She never returned home. 

Police spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane said they were still waiting for DNA results to confirm that the body found burned beyond recognition in the vehicle was that of Msipha. The constable had been stationed at the Mthunzini Police Station. ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
Although a positive identification is yet to be made, her 35-year-old boyfriend and a 33-year-old alleged accomplice had since been arrested. 

They appeared at the Nyoni Magistrate's Court  on Wednesday, said Zwane. 

They were remanded in custody and are expected to return to court next Wednesday for a formal bail application.
