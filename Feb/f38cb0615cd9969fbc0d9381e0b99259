Two toddlers have been hacked to death on the KwaZulu-Natal South Coast.

According to a source, the pair - aged two- and three-years-old - was attacked as they slept, in the early hours of Sunday morning.

An older female relative who was with them at the time was also attacked but survived.

The man police believe was behind the attack - and a relative of the victims - was knocked down by a truck shortly afterwards.

Police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane said two counts of murder and one count of attempted murder were opened at Port Shepstone police station.

“It is alleged that the suspect fled the scene and later was knocked by a truck along N2 freeway. A case of culpable homicide will be opened. It is not clear whether he wanted to commit suicide or not,” Zwane said.
