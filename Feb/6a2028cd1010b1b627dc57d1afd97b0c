Five people are expected to appear in court for an alleged vigilante killing in KwaMashu. 
Police spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane said the group were arrested for the murder of an unknown man last week. The man was accused of being involved in criminal activity in the area. 
Acting Provincial Commissioner Major General Bheki Langa has condemned their actions saying members of the community should not take the law into their own hands. “It is unaccepted for citizens to break the law and all those involved should face the long arm of the law."
Zwane said the investigation was ongoing and more arrests were imminent. 
Langa said said police appreciated the involvement of communities in assisting the police to fight crime but were disappointed by those who take the law into their own hands. "Suspects who are sought or suspected to be involved in criminal activities should be handed over to the police if they are arrested by those making a citizen’s arrest,” he said.
The group is expected to appear at the Ntuzuma Magistrates Court on Monday.
