Cape Town - Firing and prosecuting President Jacob Zuma would be in the best interests of the country, the Democratic Alliance said.
"The immediate removal and criminal prosecution of Jacob Zuma and all his corrupt cronies within the ANC is what is in the best interests of the country," said party leader Mmusi Maimane.

"Swift and decisive action is what we need, not a Ramaphosa-Zuma talkshop."

Zuma and his deputy Cyril Ramaphosa, who in December succeeded Zuma as leader of the ruling African National Congress (ANC), have been engaged in talks regarding the future of the current head of state.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

Opposition parties claim the talks are not bearing fruit and Zuma is digging in his heels and refusing to resign. The parties want a motion of no confidence debate in Zuma, which is already set for February 22, to be brought forward.

"Let Parliament do its job and move on," Maimane said.

Amid rumours that Zuma wants legal protection in exchange for resigning, Maimane said Zuma cannot be allowed to hold the country to ransom.

"If he wants extra protection, there is no other place as secure as a maximum security prison."
