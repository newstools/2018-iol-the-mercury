Police responded to violent unrest at a south Durban high school on Tuesday, when hundreds of pupils apparently stormed a neighbouring property in a bid to remove the occupants and claim the space for themselves.Sizwe Lombo, a 21-year-old who lives on the property in Seaview with his mother, was injured in the fracas.Lombo explained that the mob descended on his home while he was preparing breakfast. He said they were armed with bricks and rocks and that when he tried to stop them, they attacked him.Lombo said Tuesday’s unrest was preceded by an incident on Monday morning, when their home was vandalised and ransacked and he believed the issue was overcrowding at Phambili Secondary School.
