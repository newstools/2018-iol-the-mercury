However, it alleged that Jones tried to hide the money as well as the recording and only when he was discovered did he instruct another officer to open a case and book it all into evidence.Jones is facing charges of defeating or obstructing the course of justice and being an accessory to or after a crime, while Maistry stands accused of general corruption and defeating or obstructing the course of justice.Govender has been charged with corruption.Senior State advocate André Calitz handled the matter yesterday but told the court that a specialist from the National Prosecuting Authority's national office, State Advocate Mbulelo Hermanus, would be taking over from next month.The court heard that the State had handed the charge sheet and docket to the defence, in the form of “a number of CDs”.The case was adjourned to early March, for Hermanus to come on record and for a “possible pre-trial conference”.
