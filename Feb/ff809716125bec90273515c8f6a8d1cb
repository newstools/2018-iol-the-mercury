He said that Zuma had requested a notice of three months but officials had noted the anxiety in the country.
"Sensitive of the need to handle this matter with dignity, the NEC once again sent a delegation to brief President Jacob Zuma about the need to shorten the time-frames so that this matter is speedily resolved. The NEC received feedback from the delegation that the President of the Republic did not accede to a shorter time frame."
The NEC said they then decided as follows:1. To recall Zuma in accordance with Rule 12.2.21.2 of the ANC Constitution, which accords the NEC the authority to “recall any public representative".2. There should be continuing interaction between the officials of the ANC and the president.Magashule said that the president will respond on Wednesday. 
The announcement comes after a marathon special ANC National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting in Irene outside Pretoria that lasted into the early hours of Tuesday morning. 
When ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa went to see Zuma on Monday night, the president reportedly said: "Do what you want to do."
