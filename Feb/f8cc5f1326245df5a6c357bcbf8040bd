On Saturday night, emergency services responded to reports that a man had been impaled on a steel fence on Masabalala Yengwa Avenue (NMR), near Jacko Jackson Drive.
Netcare 911’s spokesman Nick Dollman said their paramedics responded just before 9pm.
“Netcare 911 responded to reports that a man was impaled on a spiked steel palisade fence on NMR Avenue near Jacko Jackson Drive in Stamford Hill.”

 Dollman said paramedics assisted the Provincial Ambulance Service who were first to arrive at the scene. He said reports alleged that the 20-year-old man had fallen out of a tree and had become impaled on the fence. He had sustained severe injuries including femur fractures and was attended to by an advanced life support paramedic. Analgesic medication was administered to manage the man’s pain.

“The Fire Department was called to the scene and they used rescue tools to cut parts of the fence away from the victim. However, as is standard practice, the man was transported by ambulance to hospital with parts of the fence still impaled in him,” said Dollman.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
