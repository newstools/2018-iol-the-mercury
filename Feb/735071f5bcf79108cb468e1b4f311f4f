A suspect is arrested in Pretoria West. Video: Rapula Moatshe"We will continue to fight the drug problem while creating opportunities for employment and productivity across the City, so that those wishing to break the chains of addiction may too live a better life - and not be condemned to a life of poverty or even death," he told a group of journalists at the National Press Club in Centurion on Wednesday night.According to Msimanga, one of the priority areas of the TMPD’s social crime prevention initiatives was drug awareness campaigns in schools and institutions within Tshwane.He said the City had partnered with the private sector to establish a drop-in centre in Brown Street to provide health, psychological and social  services to substance abusers."Brown Street is commonly known for being a home to drug users, and predominantly unemployed, homeless young males. It is an area of concern which our administration continues to monitor," Msimanga said.Pretoria News
