“When we arrived at the scene, the fire had burned through the roof and the four rooms of the house were fully engulfed,” he said. 

Zikhali said due to the position of the man’s body, he is believed to have died in his sleep from smoke inhalation before being burned. 

“We suspect the fire started in his room because of the rafters were completely burned and the intensity of the fire in the room when we arrived.” 

Firefighters managed to completely extinguish the fire within 20 minutes. 

Meanwhile, a 17-month-old baby who was injured in a house fire in Queensburgh has died in hospital. 

Rescue Care spokesman Garrith Jamieson said the boy had been rescued by firefighters from the flat fire on January 27. 

His mother had also suffered injuries after falling from the building in an effort to escape the flames. 


The cause of both fires is being investigated by the Durban Fire Department.
