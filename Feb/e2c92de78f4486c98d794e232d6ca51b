Resigning as president of South Africa was a heroic act by Jacob Zuma, says King Goodwill Zwelithini. 

Speaking at the opening of the KwaZulu-Natal Legislature at the Royal Showgrounds in Pietermaritzburg on Tuesday morning, the king praised the former president, who was present at the event. 

"I am glad he did not see resigning as a sign of cowardice as I did not, only a fool does not realise that his decision was heroic." 

He said Zuma did well not follow the bad example of leaders in other parts of Africa who refuse to leave office and become dictators. ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

The king rubbished reports that Zulu warriors were ready to take up arms to defend Zuma and warned politicians not to stoke fires. 

The king asked that Zuma's successor President Cyril Ramaphosa be given a chance to  "show what he has got." 

"It was expected that there would be a cabinet reshuffle, it is the president's right. He has done that, we urge that he must do what will move the country forward. It is important to move the country forward and not backward," he said. 

The king also praised IFP leader Dr Mangosuthu Buthelezi saying he was a wealth of knowledge. 

He said people should learn from Buthelezi's wisdom. 

Having; "never been part of party politics," the king said he was not praising these leaders as a endorsement of any faction or political party. "If I am, who will guide you? I reprimand everyone, any political party where there is fault."
