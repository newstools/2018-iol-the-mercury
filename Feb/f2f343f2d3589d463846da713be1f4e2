At least seven suspected heist men were left dead after two shootouts with police, who tracked them for more than 100 kilometres through the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands on Monday.

This according to a police source, who said the dramatic gun play started in the Hilton area on Monday morning, after a cash-in-transit robbery in the country town.

He said at least four suspects had been shot and killed in an exchange of gunfire there.

Another four had escaped, he said, but police on Monday afternoon found them near the Mariannhill Toll Plaza.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

There, he went on, they tried to apprehend the suspects but came under heavy fire from them.

Police returned fire, killing three of the suspects and injuring the fourth, the source said.

Rescue Care’s Garrith Jamieson said on Monday afternoon that paramedics had treated a critically injured male for gunshot wounds after a shooting incident, just before the toll.

“Three others were declared deceased on scene,” he said.
