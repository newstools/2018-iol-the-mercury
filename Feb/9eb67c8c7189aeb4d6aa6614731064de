Before midnight, ANC president Cyril Ramaphosa and secretary general Ace Magashule were tasked with delivering the recall verdict to Zuma at Mahlamba Ndlopfu in Pretoria.It was however unclear how Zuma received the decision to recall him.

The opposition motion would also force the ANC to defend Zuma again, even when he has been told by the party’s leadership to step down.Also read: #OppositionMeeting: Parties want Parliament to be dissolvedConstitutional law expert Shadrack Gutto said it would, however, be a mammoth task for opposition parties to successfully dissolve Parliament and call for early elections, as this was likely to be met by stern resistance by the governing ANC.He said the ANC could succeed in blocking attempts for Parliament to be dissolved.Gutto contended that the opposition parties were postulating on this route because they have realised the difficulties of removing Zuma through a vote of no confidence – having failed to do so on eight previous occasions.“But that is their opinion and they can go ahead and confront the matter from all angles and dimensions that all political parties in a multiparty democracy have a right to,” Gutto said.Gutto said opposition parties could try the impeachment route, in terms of section 89 of the constitution, but this would also be difficult as a two-thirds majority would be required to impeach a president.However, a simple majority of 201 Members of Parliament would suffice to pass a motion of no confidence, where the entire cabinet would have to be disbanded and a new president appointed by 30 days, Gutto said.Political Bureau
