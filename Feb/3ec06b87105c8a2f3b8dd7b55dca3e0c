Unemployed education graduates have appealed to the KwaZulu-Natal Premier intervene in the alleged sale of teaching jobs. 

A group of about 150 graduates marched through the Durban CBD calling for and end to “corruption and nepotism” in the Department of Education. 

Organised under the banner Unemployed Educators, the graduates from various institutions demanded transparency in the department’s database for teachers looking for work. 


In their memorandum of they also demanded the sale of jobs to cease. “This is happening, leading to teachers being employed temporarily for long period of time, then when others buy the post through connections, the temporary teacher is removed.” They called for the Premier Willies Mchunu to launch a probe into this allegation. 


Just last week, head of department Dr Enoch Nzama told the Standing Committee on Public Accounts (SCOPA) at the KZN Legislature that the department was at risk of collapsing as it did not have funds to fill crucial vacant posts. 

This despite the department R47.477 billion in 2017/2018. This is  42% of the provincial budget and the biggest chunk of all the departments. 

No one from the department of education was at the Durban City Hall to receive the marchers’ memorandum when they arrived.
