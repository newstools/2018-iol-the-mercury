The body of a Gauteng man has been found floating at a Durban beach, just hours after he received the news of his son having committed suicide. 
The 49-year-old man was in Tongaat for a relative’s funeral. 
The Community Emergency Response Team (Cert) in the area, said they were called in to assist search at Genazzano Beach on Tuesday night. 
 Cert chairman Nazir Sadack said the man’s vehicle was found at Casuarina Beach. It was initially assumed he went for a walk and needed time to get to grips with the death of his son, who was in his 20s.  
But after the search yielded no results, relatives reported him missing at the police station on Wednesday.
“The search resumed at 4:30 this morning and at about 9am I spotted the body floating in the water,” said Sadack.
It was brought to shore by lifeguards and identified by family and friends on scene.
