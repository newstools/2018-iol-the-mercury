Almost 60 police officers working in the Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit (FCS) have criminal records, including for culpable homicide. 


This was revealed by the ministry of police in a response to parliamentary questions from the DA police spokesman Zakhele Mbhele. 

The response names and shames the 57 officers based at various police stations around the country, including two from Port Shepstone FCS.

Like most of the other cases, this KwaZulu-Natal pair were convicted of road related crimes, one of reckless and/or negligent driving and the other for driving a motor vehicle whilst under the influence of alcohol. Both are sergeants. ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads


However, other officers were found guilty of theft and various forms of assault. Three officers were convicted of culpable homicide. One was fined R4000 or 18 months imprisonment, of which half is suspended for five years and the another R2000 admission of guilt fine as well as six months imprisonment, suspended for five years. The other did not have the criminal charges condoned. 

Mbhele said in a statement on Sunday, it was; “ totally unacceptable that the FCS units has compromised members.”

The DA called for Police Minister Fikile Mbalula to urgently brief Parliament's Police Portfolio Committee on how he intends to “root out” these members. This, as he believes these officers are; “patently not the kind of people who should be working with children or the victims of domestic or sexual violence.”

Mbhele said it was clear from their “questionable conduct” that they cannot be entrusted with the responsibility of addressing the extremely high levels of violence against women and children.

“The DA will hold Minister Mbalula to account to root out these officers and to replace them with untainted individuals who will diligently bring justice to the victims and survivors of sexual abuse and domestic violence,” said Mbhele.
