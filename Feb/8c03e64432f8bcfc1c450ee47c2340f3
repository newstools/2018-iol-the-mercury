Former Sodwana Bay guesthouse owner André Slade has been fined R50 000, payable to a charity, for racist remarks he made in 2016.

The Equality Court in Ubombo, Zululand, this week ruled that Slade’s comments and conduct amounted to unfair discrimination on the ground of race and hate speech and that they went against the constitution.

Slade and the Sodwana Bay guest house, which he ran, came under fire in 2016 after a Durban woman, Sizakele Msimango, received an email from Slade which said: “We do not accommodate blacks or government employees any longer.”

His guest house was subsequently shut down following an inspection by a team from the uMhlathuze Municipality's environmental health department.

Through the South African Human Rights Commission, the iSimangaliso Wetland Park Authority and the Department of Tourism, took the former guest house owner to court last year.

In addition to being fined, Slade was this week also ordered to immediately remove any material that amounted to racism, inequality and hate speech from his website and his publications - which the magistrate said amounted to “racism, inequality and hate speech” - were banned from publication and distribution in South Africa.
