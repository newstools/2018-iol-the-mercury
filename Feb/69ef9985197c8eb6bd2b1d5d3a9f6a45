The popular Umhlanga Beach has been closed after an e-coli contamination scare. 

No bathing is permitted until the quality of the water has been found to be clear of contamination due to a burst sewage pipe. 

Dewet  Geldenhuys, manager of the Umhlanga Urban Improvement Precinct (UIP) said eThekwini Municipality's waste water worked through the night to identify the the leak. “(The) issue (was) deep in the vegetation between the top section of the promenade on the lower terraced level,” he said.

Although the beach is closed, the promenade is open and fully usable said Geldenhuys. 

Although there is a notice warning beach goers of the closure, lifeguards were patrolling the beach to ensure nobody enters the water. The notice lists the status of e-coli status and another bacteria as critical.

The Umhlanga UIP is also monitoring the situation. 
Meanwhile, Margate's main beach has been closed for more than two weeks due to contamination from an unknown source.
