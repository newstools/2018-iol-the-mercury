Durban University of Technology (DUT) students have taken to the streets, calling for the institution’s management to re-open its wage negotiations with the trade unions.

This, as a protracted staff strike on Monday got into its sixth week.

A crowd of more than 100 students  marched on City Campus on Tuesday morning.

But moments before they arrived, Mi7 security guards - who were dressed in full riot gear - rushed to the front gates and secured them with heavy padlocks.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

A tense standoff with the students followed but after about 45 minutes, they were dispersed.

They were, however, expected to reassemble on Wednesday morning.

The South African Students Congress’s (Sasco’s) provincial secretary, Mqoldisi Duma, told The Mercury the students wanted the wage negotiations re-opened.


“This strike has been carrying on for almost two months now,” Duma said, “As the student organisation that leads the institution, we are saying that management  must re-open the negotiations”.


Duma said the students were directly impacted and that the longer the strike continued, the more dire the situation became.

“We cannot have students who are unable to study because of a workers’ strike,” he said.

But he also pledged his support for the striking staff.

“We fully support the plight of the workers, understanding their background, and as Sasco, we are biased toward the poor. Those are our principles, as an organisation,” Duma said.
