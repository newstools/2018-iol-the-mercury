Durban - A health education counsellor has been suspended after allegations of sexual assault of five pregnant women at a Durban clinic.

Department of Health MEC Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo said in a statement on Thursday that the women reported that the 45-year-old man; “touched their private parts individually during their consultations with him. Others were allegedly told to take off their panties and then he touched their genitals with a glove.”

The man is a lay counsellor based at the Cato Manor Community Clinic and is responsible for patient education aimed at helping facilitate and promote basic knowledge about HIV as well as adherence to treatment.

Dhlomo said he was shocked and disgusted by the reports.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

“We are really taken aback by these allegations. The Department has no place for people who prey on unsuspecting clients by perpetrating such an atrocity.”

The incidents described by the department as indecent assault,  came to light after the women were overheard on the corridor of the clinic about what had happened to them. They were interviewed by a senior manager who alerted district management, said Dhlomo.

“As a Department, we are always making a clarion call on women to present themselves to health facilities as soon as they suspect that they may be pregnant. We always preach the gospel that those who have been confirmed to be pregnant must attend antenatal clinics and follow the schedule as prescribed by healthcare workers. Now, for someone to allegedly violate these women in this manner really flies in the face of all of our efforts. The mere thought of something like this is sickening. We hope the law will take its course and rid the Department of this bad apple,” he said.

The department has launched an investigation with a hearing schedule for February 15.  “The Department understands that no formal criminal charges had been laid yet against the lay counsellor,” Dhlomo said.
