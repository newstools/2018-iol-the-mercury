Durban University of Technology has announced a lock-out of striking staff, as a wage strike which has gone on for six weeks continues, now with the support of students. 

This was communicated to the  three unions with members at the university, in a letter on Tuesday. It stated that the university was giving 48 hour notice of the lock-out of staff who are members of the union, meaning they will not be allowed on university property. 


This would be lifted only upon the acceptance of the university’s final wage offer of a 6.5% salary increase and the same amount for housing allowance. 

Staff are demanding an 8% increase. 

On Monday, staff’s salaries were docked as the university has instituted a no-work no-pay policy.  On Wednesday, students joined the strike.

Speaking at a press briefing on Thursday, Vice Chancellor Professor Thandwa Mthembu said the university management met with the SRC to keep them abreast of the wage negotiations. 

He said it was within the university’s rights to lock out staff, as it was part of his mandate curb the strike and protest culture at the university. 

Mthembu urged staff to abandon the strike and return to work. 

While at the briefing striking staff and protesting students picketed outside his office.
