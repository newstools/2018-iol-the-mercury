Durban- Following the murder of three people in the Glebelands Hostel in Umlazi, Durban last week, the KZN MEC for Transport, Community Safety and Liaison, Mxolisi Kaunda has asked the police to intensify operations. 

MEC Kaunda said since last year there has been relative calm in the hostel following the interventions made by the provincial government, eThekwini Metro and the police. 
"These include increasing the number of police patrols, installation of CCTV cameras and the mobile police station within the hostel," he added. 
Kaunda asked the police to speed up the investigations to establish if the recent murders are linked to the violent incidents which affected the hostel in the previous years.
“We must commend the police for their sterling work in stabilising the hostels by arresting several suspects who were at the centre of the conflicts in Glebelands,” said Kaunda.

Early last year, police arrested eight suspects, including a policeman who is currently awaiting trial, for a string of charges including murder. AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
Kaunda has described the latest incident as "unfortunate" given the resources government has deployed to bring peace and stability to the hostel. 
“As the provincial government, we would like to call for calm in the hostel and urge people who may have witnessed the incident to share information with the police so that perpetrators of the recent murders can be brought to book,” said Kaunda.
"Officials from the Department of Community Safety and Liaison are currently working within the hostel to activate crime-fighting structures and the peace committee to ensure the safety of all residents," added Kaunda.
