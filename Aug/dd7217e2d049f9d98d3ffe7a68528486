Durban - A 32-year-old KwaDukuza (Stanger) man has been sentenced to life and 95 years imprisonment in the Durban High Court after pleading guilty to nine counts of rape and seven counts of robbery with aggravating circumstances.

On Thursday, the court heard how the victim performed poorly at school, and the embarrassment of having to report the rape to family members.
The man committed the crimes in the Groutville, Thembeni, Charlottedale and Chibini areas from 2011 to 2016, where he would attack the complainants, aged between 16 and 55 years old, while on their way to work, church or school.
He would rape the complainants and then make off with their money and/or cell phones. On one occasion, the accused acted with two companions. He also used a knife and gun to threaten the women.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
DNA evidence was used to link the man to eight victims, and the ninth victim positively identified the man.

The man was sentenced to life and 80 years imprisonment for the rape charges and 15 years imprisonment for the robberies.
 
The Director of Public Prosecutions in KwaZulu Natal, Adv. Moipone Noko said the sentence was appropriate given the crimes committed.
“This sentence should go a long way in addressing the scourge of sexual violence,” she said.
