DURBAN - THE Dlaminis are a popular surname in South Africa, with the likes of socialite Minnie Dlamini, Minister Bathabile Dlamini, star pundit Amanda Dlamini and the student activist, Mcebo Dlamini. 
But beyond the above-mentioned luminaries, the Dlaminis were also South Africa’s most productive baby makers last year.
But this is not unchartered territory for the Dlaminis of the Nguni clan, in 2014, 2015 and 2016, they were again South Africa’s biggest supplier of babies. 
Yep. This is according to Statistics South Africa’s Recorded Live Births 2017 paper which was revealed this week. 
Stats SA said the report was based on the birth registration records from the Department of Home Affairs (DHA).
