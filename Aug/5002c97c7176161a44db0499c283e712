Durban - The Department of Health in KwaZulu-Natal has been mandated to speed up the administrative process in order to build a parking bay for staff at the Inanda Newtown A Community Health Care Centre. 

The announcement was made on Tuesday following a surprise visit made by the KZN Health MEC, Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo. 
Dhlomo said previously the department had to beef up security at the care centre after staff were falling prey to crime. 

 


Dhlomo noted that staff had previously been hijacked and cars, parked along the side of the road outside the centre, had been broken into. 

The MEC further commended staff at the centre, who despite the challenges, managed to work well in the area, which is categorised as a large catchment area. 

 


“While there was a definite need for the facility to be extended, the safety of staff and their property was more pressing. I am pleased that two plots of land within the precinct of the facility had been identified,” Dhlomo said.
