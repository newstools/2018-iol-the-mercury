DURBAN - Heavy rainfall and snow 
 that may lead to localized flooding is expected 
 in areas along the KwaZulu-Natal South Coast and southern Drakensberg.

 
The South African Weather Service said extreme heavy rain and severe thunderstorms which may cause hail and strong winds would cause very cold conditions with snow on the high grounds and mountains, as well as strong gale force winds along parts of the South Coast.
Ayanda Nsele, a weather forecaster said people living along the South Coast and areas along the sea can expect 60% rainfall this afternoon and 30% in the early hours of the Friday morning.
“Areas that will be mostly affected are just areas along the sea and the South Coast,” said Nsele.
Nsele said the southern Drakensberg would be affected by snow in the evening. She said the weather would clear up by the weekend.
