Durban - By Tuesday evening, residents in the KwaZulu-Natal town of Impendle will have access to WiFi. This as Minister of Telecommunications and Postal Services, Dr Siyabonga Cwele is scheduled to lead the Department’s Imbizo and launch the free public WiFi programme in Impendle on Tuesday morning.

The rolling out of the programme is thanks to a partnership between the department, KZN provincial government, uMgungundlovu District Municipality and the Impendle local municipality.
It is being rolled out by the Universal Service and Access Agency of SA, which reports to the department.
The provision of free public WiFi services in rural areas which are classified as underserviced in terms of telecommunications infrastructure is one government’s interventions to expand services to all while contributing to lowering the cost to communicate.
The free public Wi Fi programme in Impendle has connected schools, health facilities, the post office, library, Thusong Centres, community centres across the municipality and the municipal offices. There are also several hotspots which have been rolled out.

Minister Cwele is expected to use the visit to the district to update the councillors on the progress in the payment of social grants. He is also expected to visit a post office to monitor the process of migrating social grant beneficiaries to the new gold card.
