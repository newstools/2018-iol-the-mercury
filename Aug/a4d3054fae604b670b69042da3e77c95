Durban - Police in KwaZulu-Natal have appealed to the community to help them crack a case of armed robbery and hijacking. The incident took place on the N3, in the vicinity of the Shell Ultra City in June this year. 

According to KZN police spokesperson, Captain Nqobile Gwala, a family had stopped at the side of the road, after the driver experienced problems with the car. 
"While trying to repair his vehicle another vehicle stopped at a distance away and two men alighted from the vehicle. The two men threatened the victims and at gunpoint, robbed them of an undisclosed amount of cash," she said. 
Gwala added that police have issued the identikits of two men who they believe can assist with the investigation. 
"The first man is tall and of slender build. He has a mustache. The second man is also tall but is a little chubbier. Both are aged between 35 and 37-years-old," she said. AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
