Durban - Awareness group, 60 Minutes Fight Against Drug and Alcohol Abuse, recently embarked on a school tour, educating hundreds of pupils on the dangers associated with substance abuse. 

Pupils from Mowat Park Girls High, Crawford College, Queensburgh Girls High, KwaHluzinqondo High, Esizibeni High and Umzinto Secondary listened as the group shared real past experiences of recovering addicts who were at The Cedars Treatment Centre at the time of the production 
Lightness Productions managing director, Brighton Hlatshwayo, said the event was all the more powerful as pupils at some schools came forward to ask for help and advice was readily offered by well trained parties and members who have been down the road of addiction and up the road of recovery.
He thanked all those who sponsored the programme for their assistance. 
“None of this would have been possible without the support of our generous sponsors. We are sincerely grateful to our 2018 sponsors. This shows selflessness and a willingness to contribute to the building of a brighter future for our youth short of the impediments that substance abuse has on one’s life,”  

“Thank you to all for your support, and for helping to make our annual school tour such an exciting, educational, rewarding and productive event,” Hlatshwayo said.
