Durban - ANC members stormed a council meeting in the Msunduzi Municipality on Sunday calling for the ouster of the Deputy Mayor Thobani Zuma.

 They accuse Zuma of leading the divisions in the council and in the Moses Mabhida region. 
 Zuma has been a subject of rumors that he was “the politician” implicated in the audio clips where the Municipal manager Sizwe Hadebe was allegedly recorded giving directive to fix council jobs on behalf of “politician”.
 Hadebe was placed on precautionary suspension by the council last week and the investigation has been launched into the allegations against him.
 A group of protesters demonstrated outside the council and later stormed the meeting, they carried placards stating that “Thobani Zuma must go” that “Thobani Zuma and Dr Ray Ngcobo has looted the city."AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

 Former councillor Sibusiso Mkhize of ward 14 in Willowfontein said they do not want the DM present as the ANC prepares to go to elections.
 “We do not want the ANC to face any stench as we head to the elections and would therefore want the DM removed from the party," he said. 
 Zuma said he will not comment on the issue, “As protocol, I am not allowed to speak to the media, the only people who can speak is the mayor or the secretary of the region.”
