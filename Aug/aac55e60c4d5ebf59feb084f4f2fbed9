Durban - Guests at the opening of The Mercury’s renowned Wine Week had good reason to raise their glasses last night as the popular event was celebrating its 40th milestone anniversary.
“This is the biggest wine-tasting show in the country and we have a new and exciting venue, Sibaya Sun Park. We are very grateful to Sun International for this partnership,” said Yogas Nair, The Mercury editor, speaking at the opening.
Exhibitors were upbeat about the anniversary event too. 
The event, which runs until tomorrow night, is a chance for wine connoisseurs and those who pretend to be experts to meet the 70 Cape wine farmers and their representatives who are showing off their products, said Greg le Roux, Independent Media group executive for events.
Another new initiative is that The Mercury has partnered with Taxify, an app-linked transport service, which is giving guests an R80 discount. “So wine tasters and those who love the bubbly bar can drink, be merry and get home safely,” Le Roux said.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

 


First through the door was Melville Vogel, Sibaya’s general manager, who said he was setting an example to all the guests expected at the event by having Taxify on standby to take him home.
Karen Bothma, representing Ken Forrester wines of Stellenbosch, said they were expecting a lot of people to attend. “As this is the 40th year, we are expecting a lot of visitors and we are ready to rock ’* ’ roll,” she said. 

Another exhibitor, Jenny Trollip of Durban, who was showing her son Ivor’s chocolate almond brittle and three flavours of fudge, which she said paired perfectly with wine, was excited to be at Wine Week for the first time.
“Forty years is so special. I hope we are invited back next year.”
