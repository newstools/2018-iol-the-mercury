Durban - The Equal Education Law Centre and Section27 have criticised the Prevention and Management of Learner Pregnancy in Schools national draft policy for being vague ­regarding implementation and for having glaring omissions.
The two bodies said it appeared that the policy focused on how pupil pregnancy impacted on government planning rather than on defining the right of pregnant pupils to access basic education. 
Tuesday marked the closing of the second round of public comments for the Prevention and Management of Learner Pregnancy in Schools policy.
The draft policy - gazetted at the beginning of the year - aims to reduce the incidence of pupil pregnancy through education.
“This policy seeks to ensure the accessible provision of information on prevention; choice of termination of pregnancy; care, counselling and support; frameworks for impact mitigation; and guidelines for systemic management and implementation,” reads the policy.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

In a joint statement the Equal Education Law Centre and Section27 said there were several problems that had been identified with the policy.
They included the policy’s failure to outline measures to be taken during pregnancy and after delivery to ensure that pupils return to school.
The policy was also inconsistent regarding who was eligible to access pregnancy prevention services, quality comprehensive sexual education and sexual reproductive health services. The organisations also said the policy was silent on the protection of the rights of pupils who became fathers, perpetuating existing societal prejudice that child rearing was the sole responsibility of the female pupils.
In response, Department of Basic education spokesperson Elijah Mhlanga said there should be no exclusion of pregnant pupils.

They must be allowed to remain in school during their pregnancies and return as soon after giving birth as was possible.
