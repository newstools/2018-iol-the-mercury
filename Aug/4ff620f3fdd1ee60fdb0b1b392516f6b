 "It is alleged that a case of kidnapping was opened at the Hillcrest police station after 11-year-old Kholiwe Blose was taken from her home in KwaNyuswa in July. An extensive investigation led police the Bhobhoyi area with the assistance of community members after a picture of the missing child was seen in print media," Mbhele said. 

 

 She added that the 45-year-old man was immediately arrested and taken to the Hillcrest Police Station for detention until his court appearance. 

 

 Mbhele said the man will appear in the Pinetown Magistrate's Court. The young girl has been taken to hospital for a medical check-up. 

 

 Meanwhile, the search for missing Sydenham boy, Miguel Louw continues. The 10-year-old boy has been missing from last month. A man has been arrested in connection with Louw's disappearance. He faces a charge of human trafficking. He is due back in court this week.
