DURBAN - Lenmed deputy chief executive Amil Devchand said his group was unaware of any discrepancies and denied collusion on rates assessments for its Shifa hospital.

“Lenmed subscribes to the highest level of corporate governance and will co-operate fully with any investigation in this regard,” said Devchand.
Nsele promised that staff involved in deliberately lowering rates assessments would be dealt with accordingly if the investigating team’s report proved intent.
He said it had not been established that valuations were incorrect.
“If any of these properties are found to be undervalued, a revised value will be submitted and rates will be calculated on the revised value and subsequently published,” said Nsele.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

Munien said he was aware of the investigation and had co-operated.
He could not comment further due to municipal protocols, but said he was awaiting the outcome of the Ernst & Young report.
The Sunday Tribune has also established that Munien is facing disciplinary action related to the GO! Durban project. Munien was fingered in a 2015 CIIU report for flouting supply chain management and other policies in the procurement of a lease for the Go! Durban project offices.
He was the acting head of the city’s real estate unit and deputy head of valuations and acquisitions at the time of the alleged offence.

The report said he signed off on the lease for offices at R13236625 as opposed to the R8233861 sum approved by the city’s bid adjudication committee.
Nsele confirmed disciplinary action had been instituted against Munien.
Ramlugaan said he was unable to comment due to internal protocols.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
