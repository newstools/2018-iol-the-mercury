Durban - Wild Coast Sun groundskeepers have worked tirelessly to ensure the golf course, which was dug up by vandals on Saturday night, is ready for the Sunshine Tour event this week. 
This comes after five sections of the premier course were vandalised at the Port ­Edward resort.
Zoleka Skweyiya, the spokesperson for Sun International - which owns the resort - said the groundskeepers, local greenkeepers, golf professionals and concerned residents had rallied together to get the damaged sections ­repaired. 
It is believed the vandals used spades to dig up the green, leaving it riddled with holes and mounds of earth. 
Skweyiya said although there were no witnesses to the incident, the vandals left messages on the flags indicating that this was just the start of further planned action, the motivation for which was ­unknown. AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

Photos of the vandalised course posted on social media stirred outrage. Commenting on a post, Sam Stone said: “What a disgrace doing this to one of the most beautiful golf courses in South Africa.” 
Royden Fisher said; “Who’s the winner with this behaviour, mindless?”
Thanking all those who helped with the repair, Skweyiya said the course was ready to host the Sunshine Tour, which starts on Wednesday.
