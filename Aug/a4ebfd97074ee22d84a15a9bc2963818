Durban - A 17-year-old Pinetown Boys High School student is still recovering after after he tripped on a gravel walkway and landed up piercing his face earlier this week. 

 Pinetown Boys, Life Orientation teacher, Brent White said school management was informed that there were boys “up to no good” at Sandy Centre,  but upon arrival he and fellow teacher Mr Banoo found none of the school’s boys there.
 Instead, White said they saw “a lot” of their boys in Leeds Crescent behind Lord William Charles Restaurant.
 “As we drove there, a number of the boys scattered and ran back to school,” said White.
 He said it was only then that they noticed one of the boy’s kneeling over and bleeding profusely.

 “Straight away the first aid instincts kicked in and Banoo and myself started assisting the boy. I also contacted emergency services immediately,” he said.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
 White praised ER24 for arriving on scene within three minutes of receiving the call.
 “Paramedics assessed the boy and found that he had been impaled in the face by a branch. It is understood that the boy had been walking when he had tripped and fell onto the branch,” said ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring.
 Meiring said the boy was treated on scene then transported to Life Crompton Hospital for further treatment.

 The boy has not returned to school and none of the boys, according to White, have come forward to explain what happened.
 Police have not received any reports of the incident.
