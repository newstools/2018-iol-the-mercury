“The vehicle driver was found slumped over the passenger. He had a gunshot wound to the neck and had died at the scene.

He said another man was found with a gunshot wound to his face, approximately one kilometre away from the scene in the vicinity of the Tongaat Crematorium.

 


Police spokesperson, Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane, said there was an exchange of gunfire between occupants of the Polo and security guards who were travelling in a Toyota Hilux bakkie.

“The motive of the shooting is unknown. A case of murder and attempted murder has been opened at Tongaat police station and no arrest at this stage,” Zwane said.
