Durban - Three police officers, accused murdering a man and then dumping his body, are due back in court on Tuesday. The three, Sergeant Mxolisi Abednigo Hadebe, Constable Ntethelelo Zamokuhle Hlophe and Constable Sboniso Perfect Mlungisi Mchunu, are expected to make their formal bail application in the Greytown Magistrate’s court. 

Ipid head, Robert McBride, is expected to attend the court proceedings. 
The officers were arrested last week after Mbongiseni Ndlela (37) was reported missing by his family. This after, the officers had fetched him from his house.
 Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) spokesperson, Moses Dlamini said Hadebe, Hlophe and Mchunu were interrogating three alleged suspects on August 2.
“The three men were detained, tortured and assaulted inside Muden SAPS cells until one of the suspects succumbed to his injuries and died. Then the police orchestrated a plan to dispose of the deceased's body by dumping it in nearby bushes. They did not report the incident to their superiors,” he said.
