DURBAN - Police detectives in KwaZulu-Natal have arrested three men in connection with the death of two Ballito people who died just after Christmas last year.
A team of police detectives arrested the three suspects, who are aged between 20 and  46. They will face murder and attempted murder charges.
Amina Haffejee, 16, and her 7-year-old brother, Abdur Raheem, were killed when the vehicle they were traveling in crashed into boulders on the N2 near Ballito.
Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said: “It is alleged that on the night of 27 December 2017, the victims were traveling on the N2 freeway when a big boulder was thrown onto their vehicle from the Tongaat bridge. Two people died and the other victim sustained injuries.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
“A case of murder was opened at Tongaat police station and was assigned to the Provincial detectives for investigation. Extensive police investigation led to the arrest of three suspects. They will be charged and will appear in the Durban Magistrates’ Court on 10 August 2018,” said Mbhele.
At the time of the incident, rewards went up to R250 000 as members of the public appealed for information.
At the time of the incident, the deaths sparked discussions about covering bridges over major freeways, a suggestion the South African National Roads Agency said was not feasible.
