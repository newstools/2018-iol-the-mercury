 Broll's chief executive Norman Raad said their most recent auction drew a strong interest from buyers and the bidding process revealed the true potential of property values. 

 

 Raad said: "The auction platform still provides the fastest solution to monetise properties."

 

 Stephens said that there has been an increase in the number of people that want to sell their properties because of recent success. 

 

 Besides the Durban CBD building a property in Cape Town was sold on auction too. A 2800m

 Raad said that sale of these properties highlighted the continuous demand for quality properties in South Africa's major centres. 

 

 He added that property has always proven to be a good investment over time but need to have a purpose for the building or the land and that it should not be vacant. 

 

 However, there has been a slump in the prices of properties in South Africa and besides the worsening market and economic conditions, the issue of land expropriation is affecting properties prices.
