Durban - It has been three days since a fire ravaged the Durban Herbal Market leaving destruction and devastation for the vendors who made a living selling traditional medicine. 

Selina Mbonambi broke down when she saw the ashen remains of her stall among the reported 60 which were burned down in the Sunday night fire.

According to Durban Fire Division Commander Nkulumo Dube, it took 15 firefighters about an hour to contain the fire and then douse the hotspots which kept flaring up as the dry herbs were highly flammable. 
Although the fire has spread rapidly, firefighters managed to save half of the market. 

The other half, was in ruins, a sight which made vendor Selina Mbonambi cry uncontrollably. 
Mbonambi, like all the other vendors, left her herbs and other wares on the table in her stall and merely covered it with a tarp overnight. 
She speculated whether the tarps had helped spread the fire. 
Pointing to an indistinguishable pile of  burned muthi, Mbonambi said she did not only lose products which were in her stall but also stock she was storing in a corrugated iron shed in the market. Although the storeroom was still standing, it was covered in soot with smoke from the burned herbs inside coming out of the roof. 

“I have not even paid for the new stock, the women who brought it from Umhlabuyalingana are coming collect their money where will I get it. Everything burned in my stall. I don’t know where I am going to turn to try and start over,” she said.
