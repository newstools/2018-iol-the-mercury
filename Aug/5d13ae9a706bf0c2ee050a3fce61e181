Durban - The family of missing 10-year-old Miguel Louw have offered a reward of R50 000 for the youngster's safe return. The 10-year-old went missing on July 17 and was last seen outside the Sydenham KFC with a man. 
 

 On Friday, the family issued the R50 000 reward adding that they will not ask any questions regarding his disappearance.

  It continues,"The reward will be paid to anyone with information directly leading to the recovery of Miguel after he is safely returned."
 
 
  
 
 
  Days after the youngster's disappearance, police arrested the man they believed was involved in the alleged kidnap. The man, who cannot be named as the charge of kidnap has since been changed to human trafficking, made his second appearance in the Durban Magistrate's Court earlier this week. 
 
 
  
 
 
  As he exited the dock, after being informed that he was to be transferred to the Durban North SAPS holding cells, the 44-year-old man claimed to have played no part in Miguel's disappearance.
 
 
  
 
 
   
 
 
  
 
 
  The community has rallied behind the Louw family since the child went missing, assisting in search efforts.
