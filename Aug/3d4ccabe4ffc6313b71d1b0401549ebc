DURBAN - A 30-year-old man was beaten and stoned to death, allegedly for stealing washing powder at a local store at the KwaMashu hostel.
Sandile Phenyane’s family found his beaten lifeless body lying on the streets of the hostel, according to Isolezwe.
Phenyane’s aunt, Fikile Phenyane, said the family would have paid for the washing powder had they been informed about the alleged theft.
“They should have reported that he had stolen that washing powder to us, we would have paid for it and now he is dead. This is painful to us as the family to have to bury a son over washing powder, it would have been better if they called the police and opened a case, now he is gone,” the aunt told Isolezwe.  AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
The aunt said Phenyane had left home at KwaMashu’s B section to go to the hostel earlier in the day. She said they received a phone call to inform the family that Phenyane had been killed over soap.
“It was only until we saw the body that we believed it,” she said. “When we asked why he was killed we were told he stole washing powder from a stall in the hostel, but we did not see that, we were told the shop owner took the soap,” said the relative.
Police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Zwane said they were investigating a case of murder and no arrests had been made. He said the incident happened on Wednesday morning and confirmed that the deceased had been beaten by the community.
The relative said Phenyane was unemployed and had two children who live in Johannesburg.
