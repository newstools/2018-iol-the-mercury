Durban – The 2018 aQuellé Tour Durban, presented by Bridge Fund Managers, has once again made a significant contribution to the efforts of the Domino Foundation by donating the organisation R200 000 from the successful 2018 event at the end of April.

The amounts that the event and Club Cappuccino have raised for the Domino Foundation have continued to grow and trustee of Club Cappuccino, owners of the aQuellé Tour Durban, Mike Lewis appreciates the effort that all those involved have put in to help donate this significant amount.
“We always said that any money made from the event must be donated to local charities,” Lewis mentioned. 
“I believe that we have achieved that and through the support of aQuellé, who have been with us for five or six years, and now Bridge Fund Managers they together are the difference between us making an OK contribution to us doing it well.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
“We look forward to continuing our relationship in the future and at the end of the day we are grateful that we can hand over something tangible to the Domino Foundation.

“We have all the confidence in the Domino Foundation and believe that we share the same values and vision so we are sure that you are going to take this money and use it wisely.”
