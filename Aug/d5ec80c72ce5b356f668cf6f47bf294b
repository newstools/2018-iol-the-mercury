Durban - The Department of Education has warned the public not to share fake news circulating on social media that offers bursaries to 4761 matriculants to pursue their studies in teaching.
MEC for Education in KwaZulu-Natal Mthandeni Dlungwane said the widespread cyber fraud activities are targeting desperate members of the public.
A public advert, which has been shared widely on WhatsApp, promises prospective students that their registration fees, tuition fees, meals and accommodation would be covered fully. 

 


The department’s spokesperson, Kwazi Mthethwa, said the advert alleges that students would be paid allowances for their practical work.

Dlungwane said: “Like many organisations, government is using Information Communication and Technology (ICT) in order to secure competitive advantages and be more effective and efficient in delivering services to the citizens, but unfortunately ICT has also made government more vulnerable to corrupt and unscrupulous elements.”AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
