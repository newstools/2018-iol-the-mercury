DURBAN - SOUTH Africans continue to share messages wishing Durban fitness trainer Sbahle Mpisane well after she was injured in a car crash early on Thursday.
Mpisane was rushed to St Augustine’s Hospital by Rescue Care Paramedics after she sustained critical injuries when her car crashed into a tree on the Victoria Embankment. 
Rescue Care Paramedics spokesperson Garrith Jamieson said they arrived to find the driver trapped in the wreckage. She had sustained critical injuries. The Durban Fire Department used the Jaws of Life to free her. 
Mpisane’s father, prominent Durban businessman Sbu Mpisane, was visiting his daughter at the hospital when Independent on Saturday contacted him. 
“She is still in ICU and we are waiting to hear back on her condition. It hasn’t changed as yet. She’s critical but stable,” he said.

It is still not clear what caused the accident. “It’s difficult to say how it happened. No one knows at this point. The fact of the matter is nobody knows what happened except her,” Mpisane said. AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
