DURBAN - THE popular ‘fitness bunnie’ Sbahle Mpisane is in a critical condition after she was involved in a “serious crash” in the early hours of Thursday morning.
Mpisane crashed her BMW sportscar at about 4.15am at the Yacht Mall near the Victoria Embankment, Rescue Care Paramedics revealed, despite not revealing her identity.
Garrith Jamieson, a spokesperson for the paramedic services, said: “A female in her twenties has been critically injured and rushed through to a nearby hospital”.
Jamieson said it appeared she had been traveling alone when the car hit a light poll and a tree.
At least two sources said Mpisane had been spotted at the popular Wine Wednesday event for young women, which is hosted at The Werehouse in the Durban Central in the Durban ICC precinct. This could not be verified.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
According to one event goer, she arrived at around 1am and was with friends who were at a table closeby. She apparently did not stay long.
