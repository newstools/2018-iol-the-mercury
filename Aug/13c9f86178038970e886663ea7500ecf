Cape Town - The Western Cape is in the grip of a cold snap which started over the weekend with snow on a number of mountains around the province and a hail storm in the Cape Town metropole on Sunday.
 

 On Saturday, the South African Weather Service issued a warning of adverse conditions with gale force winds, heavy rains and localised flooding. The heavy rainfall came as a welcome boost for the province's dam levels which are sitting at just over 60 percent at the moment.Â 

 

 It was the snow, as always, which captured the most attention on social media though. Many locals posted pictures of the snow covering the Cederberg, Hex River Mountains and the Boland mountain ranges.
