Durban - The getaway car that four armed robbers used in the uMhlanga jewellery shop robbery last week had been hijacked from a residential neighbourhood just outside the city.
Durban North SAPS spokesperson Captain Raymond Deokaran said the Hyundai Elantra was recovered on Portland Drive, a few kilometres from Protea Mall on Chartwell Drive, where Anastasia Jewellers was robbed on Thursday.
“The getaway vehicle was recovered about 5km from where the incident took place. When we searched the vehicle we found out that it had been hijacked in Cato Manor,” said Deokaran.
Gregory Munemo, a witness, said the robbers took about two minutes inside the shop before two men came out with bags; two more were waiting in the getaway car.

One employee sustained moderate head injuries and was treated at the scene before being taken to hospital.
Haden Searles, the Durban-North uMhlanga Community Police Forum chairperson, said the robbers were “obviously” organised.
“They dropped off the car, then jumped into another car, taking the registration plates with them,” said Searles. He said the Urban Improvement Precinct (UIP) manager was near the shop and witnessed the thieves come out - one wearing a wig and women’s clothing.

“At least one of the suspects was armed with a rifle believed to be an AK47; it could have turned into a bloodbath should they (UIP) have engaged them there and then. It would have been a devastating experience with multiple restaurants and members of the public right there,” said Searles.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
He said there was not much more that could have been done by the responding officers, and that people needed to be more alert.
“Be aware and alert, don’t be complacent - not that the people in the store were not alert, but we all need to be constantly alert.
“If people see something out of the ordinary and suspicious, they must report it ­immediately,” said Searles.

Jacques van der Merwe, from a nearby restaurant, said since the robbery it had been business as usual, with no complaints of people being fearful and no noticeable ­decrease in customers.
Deokaran said the police were working on leads, but no arrests had been made.
