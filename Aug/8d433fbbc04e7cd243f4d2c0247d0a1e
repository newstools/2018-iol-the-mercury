Durban - A 36-year-old police officer has been killed in a gun battle with alleged suspects in the KwaMashu hostel on Friday night at about 6pm.

Another officer, 28, was shot in the leg and is receiving treatment at a Durban hospital.
Police said the Ethekwini Inner North Cluster officers were conducting operations at the infamous hostel when they heard gunshots emanating from an informal settlement within the hostel.
Police spokesperson Brigadier Jay Naicker said two armed suspects were carrying firearms when the police responded to the gunfire. 
“The suspects fled along the railway line and fired shots towards the two police officers. One police officer was fatally wounded and the second sustained gunshot wounds to his leg. A manhunt is underway for the suspects,” said Naicker.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

“We will not rest until they are found and we will leave no stone unturned in the process. We are also appealing to the community to come forward and expose these thugs. Our heartfelt condolences go out to the family of the late police officer and we wish our colleague in hospital a speedy recovery,” he said.
