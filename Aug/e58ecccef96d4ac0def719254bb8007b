Durban - Owners of Hilton Honey Farms have rushed to calm fears after concerns were raised about the sugaring down of honey products.

According to Rob and Liz Beach, owners of Hilton Honey Farms, there has been consumer confusion regarding C3 and C4 sugars found in honey. 
“Honey consists of C3 and C4 sugars and a variety of minerals, vitamins, pollen and wax. There is a natural blend of C3 and C4 sugars in all honey, especially from KZN where sugar cane is grown. Fynbos honey and the famous Manuka honey from New Zealand contain high levels of C4 sugars. Honey collected from flowers produces C3 sugars and honey collected from grasses like sugar cane and Paspalum produces C4 sugars. There are no laws in South Africa regarding levels of these sugars and this can only be tested overseas,” Beach explained. 
The couple was commenting following a segment on Carte Blanche, where it was alleged that Hilton Honey Farms added sugar to their honey resulting in an elevated C4 sugar reading.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
Beach said they have supplied a good product to KZN for the past 35 years and would never intentionally do anything to jeopardise our products. 

“We purchase as much locally produced honey as possible from local beekeepers and blend it into our other honeys which we import from reputable suppliers. It maintains a flavour, body, aroma and rich colour to which our local customers are accustomed and enjoy,” he said.
