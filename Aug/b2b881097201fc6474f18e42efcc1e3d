Durban - KwaZulu-Natal’s Health MEC Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo has paid tribute to the late Professor Bongani Mayosi who took his own life last week. 
Mayosi was the University of Cape Town’s Dean of Health Sciences and was an acclaimed cardiologist, researcher and the recipient of the country’s highest order, the Order of Mapungubwe.
Dhlomo said Mayosi was set to be part of the establishment of the African Institute of Health Leaders. Dhlomo and Mayosi were medical students together in the 1980s and both were political activists, he remembered.
“Bongani was part of us in early 1983, when we marched in this university (now known as UKZN) together with professors who supported us, in protest against a law that prohibited us from coming immediately into this university unless we had permission to do so.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
“He was part of us when we held night vigils when we protested against the hanging of ANC leaders who were fighting for our freedom. He was part of us when we hired a bus when we went to Cape Town to launch the UDF,” said Dhlomo.
Mayosi was close with freedom fighters like the late Andrew Zondo who was executed for his part in the eManzimtoti bombings, said Dhlomo, but he was an astute academic. 
“As much as he was a political activist, he made his mark as an astute academic in the medical field, both as an undergraduate and post-graduate. He continued being a mentor, researcher and role model recognized locally and internationally,” said Dhlomo.
Mayosi will be laid to rest on Saturday in an official provincial funeral, which will be open to the public. The funeral will take place at the Cape Town International Convention Centre from 8.30am.
