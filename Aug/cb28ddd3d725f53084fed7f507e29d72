Durban - A number of church bodies have gone to court to challenge the Ingonyama Trust Board’s plans to convert permission to occupy certificates into residential leases. 
The applicants include the KZN Council of Churches, the KZN Catholic Church, Lutheran Church and civil society organisations. 
They claim the move contravenes the Interim Protection of Informal Land Rights Act.
Thabiso Mbhense, a lawyer from the Legal Resource Centre which is representing the applicants, said the conversion from the permission to occupy certificates to residential leases would impact negatively on rural communities under the trust.
The application is expected to come before the Pietermaritzburg High Court this month.

Judge Jerome Ngwenya, the chairperson of the Ingonyama Trust Board, did not respond to messages put forward by The Mercury on Tuesday.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
Mbhense said: “With the permission to occupy certificate, people do not pay rent and although they don’t have title deeds, they live on the land as if they own it as they are protected under the Interim Protection of Informal Land Rights Act.
“This act says that nobody can remove them from the land, and nobody can take their property without their consent."
Under lease agreements, he added, people would have to pay rent and have the size of their land reduced, because they would not be able to afford the rental.

Mbhense said unmarried women, in particular, under the lease agreement would have the land they occupy reduced because they would not be able to afford to pay rent to the traditional ­authority.
“Some churches are affected because they’re also now being forced to sign lease agreements, when they have always had permission to ­occupy certificates,” he added.
