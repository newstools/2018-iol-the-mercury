Durban - Five young entrepreneurs, who went to the North Regional Business Fair at Bridge City Mall in KwaMashu to gain insight on how to grow their businesses, got more than they bargained for as they were given a full set of bakery equipment.
Ntombifikile Sibiya, 23, who is part of a group of co-operatives called Vukuyibambe, had made a request for assistance from eThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede at the opening of the fair on Friday.
“When the mayor was delivering a speech, there was a young lady who stood up from the audience and asked questions and also raised that they have shortcomings in terms of their equipment. On the spot, mayor Gumede confirmed that she was going to deliver this equipment to them on Sunday,” said councillor Sipho Kaunda, the chairperson of the economic development and planning committee, who handed over the equipment.
Sibiya said baking was her passion. “I don’t know what to say but ‘thank you’ to the mayor and the municipality for giving us this opportunity.”
