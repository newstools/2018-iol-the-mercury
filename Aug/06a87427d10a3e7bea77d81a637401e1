Durban - Shocking statistics have revealed that more than 3 000 girl children aged between 10 and 14 became mothers in South Africa last year.
The Recorded Live Births report, which is commissioned by Statistics South Africa, showed that a total of  3 261 girl children aged between 10 and 14 were registered as mothers in South Africa last year. Of the 3 261, 1 959 registered the births late, which meant the babies were born earlier, but alerted government of their births last year.
The report also showed that there were more than 100 000 teenagers who gave birth last year. 
The report showed that 119 645 young women aged between 15 - 19, registered births in 2017. Of the 119 645 births, more than 97 000 births were from 2017, while 22 000 were registered late - which meant the children were not born on the year of their registration with government.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
“The high proportion of births registered later than the year of occurrence were observed for age groups 10−14 years and 50−54 years is also observed in the unspecified or age category outside 10−54 years."
“For this age group (50-54) about 72% of the births were registered later than the year of occurrence. It is possible that those registering these births might not be the biological parents of the children and hence the late registrations,” the report stated.
