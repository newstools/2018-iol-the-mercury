Durban - The DA KZN leader Zwakele Mncwango has questioned the methodology used by Stats SA after the release of the KZN Satisfaction Survey on Friday. The Stats SA commission report reveals that people in the province were more satisfied with the services from provincial government as opposed to the local government.

The survey said 40% of citizens were satisfied with services, while 60% had varying degrees of dissatisfaction. The survey was conducted on over 22 000 households in KZN.
Mncwango questioned the sampling by Stats SA.
“If you sample people from the townships and suburbs, you are bound to get different results compared to villages where infrastructure is still lacking,” Mncwango said.

The DA KZN leader said he met many people around the province who complained about the lack of service and he believed that if corruption was curbed, the province was capable of delivering services to the people.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

The survey showed that the top six issues most complained about by the citizens were water and sanitation, electricity, clinics, affordable housing, crime and corruption, and road maintenance.
The report said citizens were most worried about job creation, housing and fighting crime and corruption. The survey focused on three Batho Pele principles namely value for money, courtesy and information. 
Speaking during the release of the report, KZN Premier Willies Mchunu said the government would be looking closely at the findings.
“While we reflect on the results and are informed of new opportunities and strategies, we must be mindful of the need to expedite delivery as we remain committed to delivering our Vision 2035.” Mchunu said.
