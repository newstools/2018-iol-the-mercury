DURBAN - THE three men who were involved in a high speed car chase with private security guards from Durban North to Morningside will spend the weekend in jail. 
Their bail application at the Durban Magistrate's Court was postponed until Monday, police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane confirmed on Friday. 
Police said the three accused, who are aged 26, 32 and 35, had broken into a car in Durban North before being pursued by private security who filmed the 'hair-raising' chase with a dash camera on August 14.
"They all appeared today (on Friday) in the Durban Magistrate’s Court for bail application and the case was remanded until Monday for further bail hearing," said Zwane.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

The man are charged with theft out of motor vehicle and are due to continue their bail hearing on Monday at the Durban Magistrate's Court.
At the time of the incident, a spokesperson for Marshall Security said the accused had collided with motorists during the high speed chase, but it was not clear if the State would add charges related to the incident.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
