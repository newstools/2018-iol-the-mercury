Durban - Reservoir Hills resident Ron Naidoo - whose telephone call to deputy mayor Fawzia Peer over service delivery went viral - can finally breathe in fresh air, she said.

At the weekend, Durban Solid Waste (DSW) cleaned up of the area she had complained about. 
And Naidoo firmly believes it was because of the heated exchange between her Peer that that got the attention of the city.

Peer then contacted Naidoo the next day. 

In the telephone recording, Peer tells Naidoo that she (Naidoo) is a rude woman and that service delivery was not her (Peer's) problem. Peer then told her to speak to the ward councilor. 
"But the one thing I want to clear up is that this is not a political issue. And I want to clear up the air. I have sent an email directly to the Mayor requesting a meeting with her so that I can tell her that this is not a political issue, but rather a service delivery issue." 
Naidoo said she was very pleased that not only was Shannon Drive cleaned up, but the entire Reservoir Hills area. 
"They have also been here daily cleaning up the place. This is how we should be living," said Naidoo who received a call from one of the managers at DSW. 

She said that she received messages from community members thanking her and also saying that they wanted to try her approach so that they could also receive service delivery in their areas. 
Naidoo said to date she has not received an apology from Peer.
