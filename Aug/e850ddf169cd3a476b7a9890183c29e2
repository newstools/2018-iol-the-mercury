Durban - Several reports, including a psychological evaluation of a 10-year-old girl, who was repeatedly raped by her stepfather over a period spanning half her life, are still outstanding in the case against him. 
The 43-year-old man made a brief appearance at the Verulam Magistrates Court on Thursday, with the court’s video remand system from Westville Prison.
The man - who cannot be named to protect the girl’s identity - is accused of raping and otherwise sexually assaulting her, sexual grooming and exposing his stepdaughter to pornography.
He was arrested in June and the girl was rescued and taken to a place of safety.

The man was denied bail in July, as Magistrate Irfaan Khalil found that it was not in the interests of justice to release the man on bail.
He said he had considered a petition signed by about 100 community members and that, if given bail, the community would likely be outraged.
The case was adjourned to October and the man was remanded in custody.
