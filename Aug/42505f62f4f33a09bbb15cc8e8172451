“The driver, a male believed to be in his 20s, had sustained major injuries and unfortunately there was nothing more than paramedics could do for him. He was declared dead at the scene,” he said.
Jamieson said a second person in the car had to be stabilised before rescue teams at the scene undertook a rescue operation to hoist the man up from the area below and on to road level.

“He was then treated by Advanced Life Support paramedics and stabilised before being rushed to a local hospital for further care,” Jamieson said.
In a separate crash in Chatsworth, a driver was killed after his car rolled.
