Durban - National police minister, General Bheki Cele is expected to attend the funeral of slain police officer, Constable Siboniso Buthelezi at the weekend. 

Buthelezi, 36, was killed following a shootout at the KwaMashu Hostel last week. He and a colleague  went to investigate gunshots that had been heard coming from the volatile KwaMashu hostel.
The police said that when the two policemen, who were in the area, went to investigate they saw two suspects fleeing. They gave chase and went into the informal settlement, where shots were fired at them.
Buthelezi was shot in the head, while his 28-year-old colleague, was shot in the thigh. 
Buthelezi’s funeral will take place in Clermont on September 1. 

Meanwhile, police union Popcru has called for changes to be made to the Criminal Procedure Act. 
The union’s Mbongeni Dladla, said police killings would continue unless the Act was amended to give police “more teeth to fight crime.”AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
“The legislation we have makes it difficult for the police to protect themselves in that they have to wait for the perpetrators to do something first, before they act. Such legislation gives more power to the criminals than the police,” Dladla said.
