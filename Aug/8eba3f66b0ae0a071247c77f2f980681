Durban - Kwaito musician Lvovo Derrango says he is willing to pay R30 000 for the safe return of his Macbook which contains five of his new unreleased songs.
The musician, whose real name is Thokozani Ndlovu, woke up to shattered glass at his Manor Gardens home after suspects entered his yard and smashed the back window of his car.
The 13 inch Apple Macbook, jackets, and sound equipment also stolen.
He took to Facebook to plead: “Hi guys another sad day. My car was broken into and I lost valuables including a 13" Macbook laptop. I just need the laptop, it has 5 songs from my album. I’m prepared to pay if anyone finds it,” he said.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

“I’m giving away a reward of R30 000 cash to anyone who returns it to me. Please DM if you have any leads. I will not call the police or anything, I just need my work laptop only. Please,” he wrote.
Police have confirmed a case of theft has been opened.
Meanwhile, Ndlovu is expected to lead a ‘Taxi Appreciation Day’ visit to the taxi ranks in the Durban CBD on Thursday morning where he will thank the taxi industry for supporting local music.
The musician became entangled in a debate on Twitter with music fans after he criticised government for not supporting local musicians when they are alive. Ndlovu had taken umbrage to criticism that ProKid, who died last week, would be assisted by the government with his burial expenses.
