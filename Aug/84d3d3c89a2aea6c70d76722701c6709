Durban - Two men fled with an undisclosed amount of cash and firearms after a cash-in-transit heist at a supermarket in Vryheid yesterday morning, KwaZulu-Natal ­police said.
National police spokesperson Brigadier Vish Naidoo said the incident took place at around 11 am.
“Guards from a security company were about to load money into an ATM machine at a supermarket in Vryheid when they were confronted by two armed suspects, one of whom fired a shot and demanded money,” said Naidoo.
“The suspects fled with an undisclosed amount of money and at least two firearms from the security guards. The vehicle used by the suspects was later discovered abandoned about 10km away from the scene. No injuries were reported. No arrests have been made as yet.”
According to a witness who was at the store at the time of the incident, “the men fired one shot into the ATM and then took the boxes of cash and ran to a car outside. The whole thing took less than a minute.

“By the time police arrived about 10 minutes later they were already gone,” he said.
No one inside the store was injured, said the witness, “but people were terrified”.
South Africa is experiencing a spate of heists, mostly in the Gauteng area. However, ­experts have warned of the possibility that as police crack down in that province, the heavily armed gangs may move to other areas.
Last week, police foiled two attempted heists in KZN. One attempt was made on a van traveling on the R34 between Nkwalini and Empangeni.

An officer was injured during the incident.
The day before, another heist was foiled on the R68 ­between Dundee and Nqutu.
