Johannesburg - With Afriforum laying criminal charges against Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema over the rifle incident at his party's birthday bash in East London, the Black First Land First (BLF) now says it will open a case against "the white gunman" seen in viral video clip being handed back the weapon.

''The irresponsible behaviour of the white gunman was calculated to cause harm to black people. The crowd which was potentially under threat was black. The intention of the white man was very clear – that harm should come to black people,'' BLF said in a statement.
The party said it will lay charges at Johannesburg's Hillbrow police station on Thursday.

  Video: Supplied
 

The video drew widespread criticism on social media, while others dismissed accusations that Malema was irresponsible in firing an automatic rifle at the event.
The red berets responded on Wednesday that the rifle was a simulation to coincide with their celebrations and that no real bullets were fired, only blanks.

BLF said it also wants the gun owner's firearm license revoked.
