Durban - Plans are afoot for some of the ANC’s KwaZulu-Natal regions to rename their structures after Struggle stalwarts. 
The ANC has 11 regions in the province, including eThekwini, Lower South Coast, Abaqulusi, Far North, Emalahleni, Ukhahlamba and Inkosi Bhambatha while three of the regions, Musa Dladla, Moses Mabhida and Harry Gwala are named after late Struggle stalwarts. 
The KwaDukuza region has resolved to change its name to the General Gizenga Mpanza Region, in honour of Justice Maqina Gizenga Mpanza, who hailed from KwaDukuza and who spent 15 years, between 1973 and 1988, on Robben Island. Mpanza died in 2002, aged 65, and at the time of his death he was a councillor in iLembe District . He joined the ANC in 1952, during the defiance campaign.
The region’s secretary Musa Zondi confirmed they had submitted their proposal, to rename the region, to the ANC’s Provincial Executive Committee (PEC).
ANC KZN spokesperson Nomagugu Simelane Zulu said the renaming of the party region was the responsibility of the regions themselves, adding that a decision had to be taken at regional conferences.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

She confirmed she was present when KwaDukuza region proposed the name change .
“They sat in a regional conference a couple of months before the PEC was elected but the Provincial Task Team (PTT) did not have the mandate to approve this request,” Simelane Zulu said.
She said it was done in line with ANC policy - stipulating any branch, region or province of the ANC could not be named after a living comrade.
Zondi confirmed that they were in the process of changing the region’s name.

He said they had already submitted their proposal to the PEC, led by chairperson Sihle Zikalala.
Zondi said the choice of Mpanza’s name was a resolution taken at their regional conference, held in Chakas Rock, north of Ballito, in May.
