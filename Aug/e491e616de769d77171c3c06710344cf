Durban - Police officers in Durban pounced on two fake police officers in Inanda, north of Durban.
The two had impersonated police officers as they forced themselves into a house at the Machobeni area in Inanda.
“They allegedly searched the house and stole snacks as well as an undisclosed amount of cash,” said police spokesperson, Captain Nqobile Gwala.
Gwala said when the people in the house realised the men were not police officers, they shouted for help.
“Together with the assistance of their neighbours, the suspects were apprehended. Police were alerted and suspects were immediately detained. Both men will be profiled to determine if they are involved in any other similar incidents,” she said.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
The arrests were made on the early hours of Monday morning, said Gwala.
“Police at Inanda with the assistance of the community members arrested two suspects both aged 28 for robbery and impersonating police officers. The suspects will be charged and they will appear in the Ntuzuma Magistrates Court,” she said.
Meanwhile, two firearms were recovered from two suspects on Monday in the Upper Tugela area.
“Upon arrival to the said area they found a pistol which had its serial number filed off, a revolver with one round in its chamber and 12 rounds of ammunition in its magazine. Both suspects aged 35 and 50 were arrested for possession of unlicensed firearm and ammunition,” said Gwala.
She said the recovered firearm would be taken for ballistic testing.
