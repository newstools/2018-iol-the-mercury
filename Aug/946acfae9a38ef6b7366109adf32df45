   Workers had to scramble out of a shoe manufacturing factory in Jacobs on Wednesday. 
  
 
 

 

 According to Zibuse Ngcece, the regional commander for Fire Department, when firefighters arrived on scene the flames were through the roof. 

 

 Ngcece said they managed to contain the fire but there is still smoke billowing out of the building. 

 

 Upon investigation, it was found that rubber and plastic in the factory caught alight. 

 

 According to Ngcebe 20 workers who had been working nightshift had to escape over the wall as they claim their supervisor had been asleep. 

 

 All managed to escape and there are no reported injuries. 

 

 This is a developing story.
