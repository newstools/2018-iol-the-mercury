 Shaadieya was accused of being in a love triangle with the deceased and the accused.  

 

 "I was there when Raman told her that he wanted nothing to do with my daughter and now conveniently the blame is put on her. 
 It has been a lot for her to bear. People are always pointing fingers, but I have told her that she should just carry on with her life," said the mother.

 

 Shaeida said she felt deeply for Pillay's mother Tracey. 

 

 "I can only imagine how she must feel losing a child. I lost my son three years ago. He was stabbed to death, so I know how Tracey feels. There are days you can't even get out of bed."

 

 But Shaeida said it was her 4-year-old grandson, Raman's son, whom she had to put all her focus on. 

 

 "The unfortunate thing is that the little boy will forever carry the stigma of this incident."

 

 Daniels said s
 he wanted to commend her daughter for raising her son and pulling through this Women's Month. 

 

 "She is going to start a new job soon. And now that the trial is over she needs to place all her focus on her son."

 

 In November 2014, 19-year-old 
 Shaadieya denied being in a love triangle but described Pillay as a good friend. 

 

 She also said that her relationship with Raman was estranged and that he had posted new pictures on Whatsapp of his girlfriend.
