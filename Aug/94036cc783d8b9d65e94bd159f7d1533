Durban - Ethekwini Mayor Zandile Gumede strongly condemned the continuous land invasion around the city and has vowed to do whatever it takes to stop this.

Gumede was addressing the executive committee sitting at the city hall on Tuesday.
She was referring to the incident of invasion in Queensburg over the weekend.
During the land grab members of eThekwini Municipality's Land Invasion Unit were allegedly attacked when they attempted to stop a group of people from invading land illegally in the Burlington area.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
“A municipal employee from the Land Invasion Unit was shot while trying to execute his duties. Another official was struck on the head by a rock while other officials sustained minor injuries. About three police vehicles were damaged. We wish our members a speedy recovery,” Gumede said.

She said a case of attempted murder was opened by the municipality and circumstances surrounding the entire incident are being investigated by the South African Police Service. An internal investigation will also be conducted by the municipality around the circumstances, she said.
“We hope that all those who are fueling these invasions will be arrested. Land invasion is counter-revolutionary; it disrupts government plans of redistributing of land. Some of the land that gets invaded is being claimed, therefore if you invade, you are equally stealing land from rightful owners. The land will return the people in a legal and peaceful manner, thugs will never succeed in trying to hijack the revolution. We have confidence in our constitution and parliamentary process that seeks to deal with the land question,” she said.
