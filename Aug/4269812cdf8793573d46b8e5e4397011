DURBAN - PRAYERS from the province of KwaZulu-Natal is going to heal our social ills, the provincial Health MEC, Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo believes.

Dignitaries including Dhlomo, along with Zodwa Mchunu, the wife of KZN Premier Willies Mchunu, and Zulu Princess Thembi Ndlovu were among worshippers from different faiths who took part in a mass prayer at Madadeni in Newcastle on Thursday.
The prayer session took place at the Enyonini Mission, at Madadeni Section 2, in Newcastle.
For Dhlomo, the prayer session was also a celebration of ANC stalwart Albertina Sisulu.
“Here, we assembled alongside women from the whole province, from different churches and religious houses, to say that women must rise up and lead. We are saying they must be leaders of society, against the abuse of women, the rape of our children; against the killing of people living with albinism, against hijackings, and against political killings. We have had these prayers, and we hope people have listened to God’s message,” said Dhlomo.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

He added: “We are here to say, let’s give ourselves an opportunity to listen to God speaking to us. We should not point fingers, but rather say, ‘We’ve been given an opportunity to do right where things have not gone right.’”
Mchunu, who is commonly referred to as the First Lady of the province called for women to return to prayer.
She said: “We as women need to return to our rightful place as intercessors and women of prayer. In the past, women knew how to pray, but today we’ve moved away from that. In the past, women’s prayer was so potent that it could end wars, and see sinners such as drug dealers abandon their ways and hand themselves to the police. We need to return to that.”
