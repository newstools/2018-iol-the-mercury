Durban - Workers at the stationery manufacturing company, Bidvest Waltons workers have walked off the warehouse floor and local stores in a wage protest.

They carried placards on Monday outside the warehouse at Riverhorse Valley highlighting what they say are poor working conditions and demanded 100% bonuses. 
In addition, staff demanded an 11% salary increase across the board and a minimum wage of R7 000 a month. 
The Bidvest Waltons employees in KwaZulu-Natal said they were further prejudiced as they were allegedly paid less than their counterparts in Cape Town.
They are also demanding double pay for working Sundays, an 18% shift allowance, and a guaranteed 13th cheque, amongst others.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

Police were on sight at the warehouse to monitor the situation while the union officials were in negotiations with management.

Also on the worker's grievances were allegations of racism. They also complained of workers being forced to use one toilet.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

"We are made to use one toilet for both males and females. We, women, feel uncomfortable to be in the same toilet wither male colleagues.We have complained a number of times to management, but we have been ignored," said a worker who wished not to be named for fear of victimisation.
The management was unavailable for comment as officials were still locked in negotiations.
