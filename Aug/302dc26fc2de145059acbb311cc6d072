Durban - Members of Umkhonto We Sizwe in the Moses Mabhida region shut down the Richmond Municipality offices on Wednesday morning and evicted municipal staff members, demanding that they be addressed on how they will benefit from opportunities at the municipality.

In the past few days they have also stormed other councils, The Mercury understands they recently visited the Msunduzi Municipality.
“We have taken a decision to close the municipality. We are not burning government property or threatening individuals. We have simply locked out the staff and only the members of Umkhonto We Sizwe are inside the premises,” said MK chair of the Richmond zone, Dumisani Ndlovu.
“There is a national agreement in place whereby government agreed that all government departments including municipalities should assist the veterans with job opportunities and tenders but that has not been happening in this municipality and others," he said. AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
