Durban - The troubled uThukela District Municipality is in danger of being placed under administration. The cabinet announced on Wednesday that it has given the department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) and its MEC Nomusa Dube-Ncube  powers to place the municipality under administration, if it decides to do so.

uThukela supplies key services like water to Ladysmith and other areas. 
 “Cabinet has given powers to Cogta to decide, using the different sections of the constitution, on how to handle that, depending on the severity of the problem,” said head of Provincial Government Communication, Mandla Msomi.
 uThukela has faced a difficult few months as disgruntled “water and sanitation” employees embarked on a violent and confrontational strike.
The strike has been nasty with allegations that disgruntled workers had dumped human waste inside the offices and also dumped it over the municipal manager’s car. It also led to the towns like Ladysmith and Colenso running out of water.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

Areas supplied by water tankers were also affected as water tankers were unable to collect and deliver water after because of the strike.
