Irate Kranskop Community members went on a rampage on Monday setting alight a farm managers house after the farm owner allegedly leveled and tried to farm over graves.

 The graves belonged to the community members.
 The community also temporarily closed the R74 road that connects Kranskop to Greytown.
They burned a farm house that housed a farm manager who is said to have fled without any injuries.
 A community member said the community has had enough of the farmer’s behavior. “He had leveled the graves totally and was continuing to do so, so that he could plant over them when the community discovered what had happened they got angry.”AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

 Colonel Thembeka Mbele said About 300 protesters have blocked the road complaining about a farmer who has graded the cemetery in the Aussicht Farm Road.
 “The road is closed as bottles were broken and placed on the road. POP, RTI and Greytown police members are at the scene monitoring the situation and clearing the road. No injuries or damages at the moment,” she said.
