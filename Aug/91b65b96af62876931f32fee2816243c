At 2:04pm, the pair wait their turn in the queue and then the man walks up to the counter and orders food.
While they wait for their order to be called, the man goes to sit next to Miguel and they are seen to be having a conversation.

A few times on the video, the man can be seen touching and holding Miguel.
Once their food is ready, the man walks to the counter and picks up the food parcel. He then walks out of the store with Miguel. He is seen holding out his hand and Miguel takes it and they continue to walk hand-in-hand.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
This was one of the last images of Miguel Louw. As the mystery around his disappearance continues, his mother spoke to Carte Blanche on Sunday night.
Raylene Louw said the accused managed to get hold of both her Identity Document and her two children’s birth certificates, which were found on him at the time he was arrested. 

Louw said at the time of the arrest, she was angry. She said the accused had met both her children. The man allegedly did odd jobs at the family's home. 
The family is continuing to appeal to the community to come forward if they have information that could lead to Miguel’s safe return.
They can contact Sydenham SAPS on 031 203 2703.
