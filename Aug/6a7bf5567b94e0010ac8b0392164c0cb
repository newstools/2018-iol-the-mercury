DURBAN - FITNESS bunnie Sbahle Mpisane’s gym partners used the Duo-Eurodance Bootcamp Tour she planned, to pray for her recovery as she fights for her life in hospital.

In an emotionally-charged training session yesterday, at North Beach’s Amphitheatre, trainers took turns to pray for Sbahle. She was involved in a horrific car accident on Thursday morning, on Margaret Mncadi Avenue (Victoria Embankment).
Her training partner Yolanda Sokhela, who led the session, said Sbahle would have wanted the tour to go on despite her absence.

About 40 gym fanatics who had gathered took turns to console Sokhela.
In honour of Sbahle, Sokhela promised she would keep the wheels of the Duo-Eurodance Bootcamp Tour turning until her gym partner recovered.

“I almost cancelled the boot camp but thought of her and decided otherwise. She is a determined person who does not give up easily, (and) would not like me to cancel the tour because of her absence,” said Sokhela.
“She is in our prayers, we are doing this for her. She is a strong and humble woman who made sacrifices to promote a healthy living lifestyle. We will do this for her,” she said.
Sbahle’s father, Sbu Mpisane, a well-known Durban businessman, confirmed yesterday she was off life support and breathing on her own. However, she remained in the Intensive Care Unit, he said.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
The father said Sbahle had suffered multiple-fractures to her legs and arms but did not sustain any head injuries.

“If you look at that accident picture, she should not have made it,” said Mpisane.
He said he had been in and out of the Netcare St Augustine’s Hospital, where she was admitted on Thursday.
“She is a fighter, she will be out soon,” said Mpisane.
He thanked Sbahle’s followers for their support.

“Her gym friends told us they would go ahead with the planned events without her.
“We are grateful for the support, it means a lot to her,” he said. According to Rescue Care paramedics, she was travelling alone when her BMW convertible apparently hit a light pole and a tree.
Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said officers at the Durban central police station were still investigating the accident.
