 They were each given a five year suspended sentence on condition that they each pay back R750 000 to their 53-year-old mother.  

 

 Both woman, who grew up in Umzinto, on the South Coast, pleaded not guilty. 

 

 The court heard that their father had died on December 24, 2015. 

 

 Five days later the sisters called a family meeting and told their mother (Mrs. Khan) that they would help manage her money because they were afraid their two brothers would steal from her. 

 

 The mother, who claimed she was in a vulnerable state and still mourning her husband, gave her daughters' access to her internet banking and provided them with all the pin numbers and passwords. 

 

 She said she had noticed money had been disappearing from her bank account from January 2016 until April 2016 and approached her daughters. 

 

 By this time she was left centless. Almost R2 million had been stolen. 

 

 Her daughters refused to return the money and broke all communication with their mother. 

 

 Mrs Khan said she had no choice and went to the police and opened a case of theft. 

 

 During her victim impact statement in court, led by State Prosecutor Kuveshni Pillay, Mrs Khan told the court that she wanted her money back. 

 

 "I worked so hard knitting jerseys and making samoosa par to raise them and now they steal from me."
