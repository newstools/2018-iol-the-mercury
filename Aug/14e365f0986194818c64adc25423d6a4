Durban - The search for the missing KZN Sharks Board employee continues as rescue workers have yet to find his body.
Siyabonga Gabela is believed to have drowned when the boat he and four other colleagues capsized near Richards Bay last Wednesday.
He and his colleagues were servicing shark nets when the sea got rough, causing the boat to overturn. Two died.
Shakier Hiraman, the chief sports and recreation officer at the city of Umhlathuze, said four divers from the SAPS had gone down to search for Gabela’s body yesterday but the search yielded no results.
