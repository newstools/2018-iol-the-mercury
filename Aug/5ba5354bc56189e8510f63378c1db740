Durban - The Msunduzi Municipality council has placed its controversial municipal manager, Sizwe Hadebe, on precautionary suspension.

Hadebe, who had been issued with a notice of intention to suspend him last week and given seven days to respond, was suspended by a unanimous council on Thursday.
The suspension follows numerous allegations against him including two recordings where he was heard allegedly colluding with another senior official to fix jobs in the council on behalf of “politicians” above him.
Other general managers reporting to him had written to the provincial and national departments of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs departments demanding he be investigated.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
Mayor Themba Njilo said, “I have informed Hadebe about the council decision. The investigator has been given 30 days to report back to council and formulate the charges as we do not want this process to drag out.” 

Attempts to speak to Hadebe had been unsuccessful.
