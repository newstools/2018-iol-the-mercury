Durban - Advocacy group Right2Know has given KwaZulu-Natal premier, Willies Mchunu, 30 days in which release the findings of the Moerane Commission.

The group has said if Mchunu fails to do so within the stipulated time, then he must furnish reasons as to why he cannot.
R2K KZN Organiser, Lazola Kati, said the request has been filed via the Promotion of Access to Information Act (PAIA).
The commission, set up in October 2016 by the premier, was to investigate the causes of political killings within the province. The commission was concluded earlier this year.
Kati said during this time, even though the Commission held open meetings, none of its transcripts was ever made public, despite numerous requests to the Commission.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

“The final report was handed to the Premier on 12 June 2018.  Shortly after that, we wrote to the Office of the Premier in June 2018 asking for the report and transcripts to be published, to no avail. After receiving the report, Premier Mchunu transferred it to the KZN legislature, which considered the report behind closed doors. Thus far the Premier and legislature have refused all calls for the report to be released. As R2K we demand transparency in all issues pertaining to the Moerane Commission of Inquiry: both the final report and the transcripts must be made available to the public,” Kati said.
Kati said withholding the transcripts and the report of the Moerane Commission is an aberration to the Constitutional values of accountability, transparency and responsiveness.
During a recent press briefing, police minister, General Bheki Cele, said he had not seen the report either.
