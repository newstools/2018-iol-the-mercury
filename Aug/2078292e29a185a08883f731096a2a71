He said they had decided to share the video on social media to alert people and possibly identify the culprits. 
But according to AV Mohamed, chairman of the Grey Street Mosque, shoe snatching is not something new. 
Mohamed said there were three reasons for shoe snatching at mosques. AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

"Firstly there is a criminal element where people come with a premeditated idea that they are going to steal.  It happens in mosques all over the world.
"The second reason is that some people don't really know where they keep their shoes. For example, Grey Street Mosque in Durban has 3 entrances and exits. Some people enter one way and then decide to exit another way. And then they cannot find their shoes. 
"The third reason is that so many people are wearing the same shoes nowadays, that they accidentally take someone else's shoe."
Mohamed said he currently had about 50 unclaimed pairs of men's shoes. 

"Ever since we installed cameras at the Grey Street Mosque two years ago, we have had about one incident to date."
He said the trick was to hide one leg of the shoe in one place, and the other somewhere else. 
"Criminals ideally want the pair."
A disgruntled wife whose husband's new pair of Puma takkies got stolen at North Beach Mosque said they had no choice but to buy another pair of shoes.
