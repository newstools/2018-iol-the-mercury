Westenburg - What at first looked like a consignment of snacks and other goods carried on a trailer, turned out to be a stolen vehicle that was being transported on the N1 near Polokwane, Limpopo police said on Wednesday.

 

 Limpopo police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said: 
 "The snap operation comprising members of Crime Intelligence, police members from Westenburg and officials from the Department of Roads and Transport yielded positive results when four suspects were arrested while transporting a stolen motor vehicle in the early hours of Wednesday morning at about 03:30."

 

 The police were busy with their routine duties along the N1 road, south of Polokwane, when they stopped a Toyota Hilux towing a trailer, after receiving information about a stolen vehicle that was being transported along the N1.

 "As the police were busy searching the vehicle and its trailer; unpacking the snacks and removing the foil, a grey Ford Ranger was found loaded on the trailer," Mojapelo said.

 

 The suspects, aged between 30 and 40, were arrested on the spot. The vehicle was reported stolen in Gauteng. 

 

 They will appear in Polokwane Magistrate's Court soon on a charge of possession of suspected stolen motor vehicle, Mojapelo said.

 

 Police investigations are continuing.
