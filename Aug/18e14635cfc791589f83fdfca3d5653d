Durban - Protests by disgruntled members of the Umkhonto we Sizwe Military Veterans Association (MKMVA) are likely to spread to other municipalities this week as the veterans continue demanding jobs and tenders.
Last week members of the association stormed the Msunduzi and Richmond municipalities in the Midlands, complaining of being overlooked when it came to houses, job opportunities and the awarding of tenders.
Services were disrupted at Richmond municipality on Wednesday when staff members were locked outside their offices by a group of MKMVA members, while on Monday they stormed the Pietermaritzburg City Hall.
Themba Mavundla, the chairperson of MKMVA in KwaZulu-­Natal, said the actions were part of the organisation’s programme.
“This is because the veterans feel that they are not being listened to. They have been asking kindly for a very long time, but nothing has come to them,” Mavundla said. 

“Instead they feel that it is these business forums which are being prioritised just because they use force. The veterans feel that maybe they have to do things this way for them to be heard.” AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
The ANC has condemned the actions, calling them “the latest trend of holding municipalities to ransom”. ANC provincial secretary Mdumiseni Ntuli said the party would take action against any members involved in the disruption of municipal services.
