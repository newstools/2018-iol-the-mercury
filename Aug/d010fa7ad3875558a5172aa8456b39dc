Asked if he was tracking the support from social media, Sbu Mpisane said he was not on social media, but was receiving snippets of information and was aware about the furore over the Doves Funeral poster on Friday which saw the 135-year-old funeral parlour receive heavy criticism on Friday afternoon.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
“I am aware of the Doves issue, but my focus is on Sbahle. I have to focus all my spiritiual energy on her so that she draws positive spirits from that, I cannot waste my energy on Doves, I am not bothered by what has been done by Doves at this stage in time,” Sbu Mpisane said.

Doves chief executive Minki Rasenyalo speaking to IOL on Friday apologised for the furore over their social media posts and said they had been deleted because of the backlash that ensued.
“We will never wish death upon anyone as a business,” she said.
Rasenyalo said Doves had been running a social media campaign titled isiKhumbuzo since the beginning of the year. She said the campaign was about changing perceptions about the funeral parlour industry, celebrating life, promoting healthy living and appreciating people while they were alive.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

“We do not profit from death, we are more for life instead of death. We need to celebrate one another while we are alive, show the good memories we have with one another and celebrate the people that contribute positively in their lives,” she said.
