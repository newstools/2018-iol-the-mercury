Cape Town - Alleged "Sexy Boys" gang boss Jerome "Donkie" Booysen has survived yet another attempt on his life. 
 

 In October last year, Booysen was critically wounded when he was shot four times at the Cape Town International Airport. He had to be moved three times while recuperating, following another attempt on his life at a Bellville hospital.
 
 
  
 
 
  According to police spokesperson Frederick van Wyk, the latest shooting happened outside a Kuilsriver mall on Wednesday afternoon.
 
 
  
 
 
  While police crime scene detectives are still on the scene, van Wyk confirmed that one person was killed and another wounded in the incident. According to van Wyk, a case of murder and another case of attempted murder is being investigated.

  The attack on Booysen at Melomed Hospital last year was the fourth in less than 12 months and his bodyguards managed to catch a man disguised as a female doctor, who allegedly tried to inject Booysen with snake venom.
