Durban - Psychologists are expected to visit the Chatsworth Secondary school on Thursday after 17-year-old pupil Matthew Joash David committed suicide last month. 

David’s mother, Judy claims her son was embarrassed and insulted by the school principal during a meeting with her, in which her son was suspended and directed to see a social worker. 
David’s said her son hanged himself with his school tie after he was called a pervert, was labelled as gay because of his hairstyle and accused of smoking and using drugs.
The DA made an unannounced visit to the school on Wednesday but the principal was not available to speak to them. They will be returning to the school on Thursday. 
DA KZN Education Spokesperson, Dr Rishigen Viranna said the claims regarding the school management’s conduct was extremely disturbing. AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

“If true, they are a severe indictment for which they must be held fully accountable. Tomorrow’s oversight will see the DA engage with those involved in the boy’s so-called impromptu disciplinary in a bid to establish exactly what was said,” he said.
Viranna said the DA would report their findings to both KZN Education MEC, Mthandeni Dlungwane and KZN Education portfolio committee Chairperson Linda Hlongwa-Madlala in the interests of swift intervention.
