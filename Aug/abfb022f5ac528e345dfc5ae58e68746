Pretoria - Eskom has announced a low possibility of rotational loadshedding during the day and possibly well into the evening due to expected increase in demand. 

The power utility advised residents who receive power directly from Eskom to check for loadshedding schedules on its website. 
Residents who receive electricity from municipalities like Tshwane and Ekurhuleni could be affected. However, their schedules will be communicated through their municipality media platforms. 
Eskom said it will advise if loadshedding will be conducted in either stage 1, stage 2, stage 3 or stage 4, dependent on the capacity shortage.  
Stage 1 requires 1000MW to be rotationally loadshed nationwide, stage 2 requires 2000MW, stage 3 requires 3000MW and stage 4 calls for up to 4000MW to be rotationally loadshed nationally at a given period. AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

The power utility said loadshedding is conducted rotationally as a measure of last resort to protect the power system from a total collapse or blackout.
At this point, power outages could frustrate Tshwane residents who recently had to live without power in some suburbs due to continuous cable theft. The theft of cables were so frequent they prompted mayor Solly Msimanga to intervene and increase metro policing around power stations.
Meanwhile, Eskom has not seen eye to eye with its workers represented by NUM and Numsa in salary and incentives negotiations. These negotiations have been dragging on for months as Eskom insisted it does not have money to meet demands at his point.
Subsequently, Eskom this morning advised all its employees to refrain from engaging in any form of industrial action or any action that retards or obstructs Eskom's operations.

Eskom will provide updates about this low-risk loadshedding through its various platforms but has encouraged users to contact the customer contact centre on 0860 037 566.
