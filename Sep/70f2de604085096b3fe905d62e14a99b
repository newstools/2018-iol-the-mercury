Apart from the orange bag investigation President Cyril Ramaphosa also authorised the SIU to investigate tenders awarded by the National Department of Water and Sanitation and by the Ekurhuleni Metro.
Another investigation looking into the maladministration in the Media, Information and Communication Technologies Sector Education and Training Authority was also authorised by the president.
The maladministration relates to the allocation of discretionary grant funding to a number of companies which will also be probed, the presidency said.
“The latest proclamations signed by President Ramaphosa complement a number of investigations called for by the President since his undertaking in the February 2018 State of the Nation Address that ‘this is the year in which we will turn the tide of corruption in our public institutions,’” read the statement.
The Department of Water and Sanitation will be probed for alleged maladministration and unlawful expenditure of public money in the procurement of information technology services from an enterprise software provider.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
