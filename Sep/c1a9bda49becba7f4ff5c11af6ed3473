Durban - The Diakonia Council of Churches, which for more than four decades has worked together with local churches and concerned citizens in Durban towards a just society, will continue its important programme work after the organisation has emerged from a recent hard-hitting financial crisis. While it is not through the woods yet it is able to keep its doors open.

Chairperson, Diakonia Council of Churches, Reverend Musa Zondi, said when some key overseas funding sources changed their funding priorities, the organisation was at risk of closing its doors earlier this year. 
"We have been overwhelmed by the love, prayers and generous support offered by the public, Friends of Diakonia and our partners. As a result, we have received diverse funding to enable us to keep our doors open," Zondi said. 
Zondi add that the financial crisis has undeniably affected staff and operations.
"We underwent a difficult restructuring process. Our social justice work is to be scaled down in the interim, until we completely overcome the crisis. While we have weathered this heavy storm, we are working on alternate means of earning income to sustain our much-needed social justice work," Zondi said. 

Echoing Zondi's comments, executive director, Diakonia Council of Churches, Nomabelu Mvambo-Dandala, said they were truly grateful to the public, member churches and all others in the wider Diakonia family for their prayers and support in all forms.
"We request your ongoing support to improve our sustainability. We do not exist apart from you, and we look forward to being able to walk into the future together to create the just world we envisage for ourselves, our neighbours and our children," she said.
