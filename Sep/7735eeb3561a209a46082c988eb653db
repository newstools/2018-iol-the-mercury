DURBAN - THE three eThekwini metro police officers who greeted a senior officer with "good morning, mlungu" and who were subsequently fired, have been reinstated to their jobs, the South African Municipal Workers Union said on Friday.
This comes after they appealed the decision internally, leading to their reinstatement with immediate effect. The appeal was heard on Friday. 
The officers, Mthembeni Mtshali, 30, Siyabonga Mzobe and Sphamandla Madida, both 38, were dismissed for dishonesty after they were found guilty of making false statements in an affidavit. In their statements they had denied that they referred to their boss as a "mlungu" and they had also claimed he had allegedly used the k-word.
The incident between the three policemen and Captain Shaine Spilsbury occurred in 2016, with the officers laying a complaint against him for the use of the k-word, while he also laid a counter-claim alleging he was called a "mlungu" at their Queensburgh Police Station base.
The internal disciplinary charge sheet had found that the word "mlungu" was derogatory.
Samwu representative, Dumile Khanya, said on Friday that the process for the hearing against the three officers was found to have been flouted.
“It was found that the trial was unfair and proper procedures were not followed. As a result, a decision was taken to reinstate them with immediate effect. It was also ruled that if the employer wishes to continue with the matter, an independent officer must be appointed to look at the matter afresh,” said Khanya.
