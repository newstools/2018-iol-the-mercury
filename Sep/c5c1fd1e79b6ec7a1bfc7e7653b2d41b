 It is unknown if there were any passengers in the taxi at the time. 

 

 A month ago, a bus caught alight on the N2 near Westwood. Passengers were treated by Rescue Care for smoke inhalation. 

 

 The privately owned bus, known as “Talk of the Town”, was en route from Phoenix to Pinetown at the time.
