Durban - The SCDIFA Cheshire Home received a much-needed cash boost recently, thanks to the generosity of SUNCOAST Security Duty Manager, Lorrence Chetty. 

Chetty donated R4065 to the home from his winnings in his company's charity drive. 
This campaign gives all employees the opportunity to have R10 deducted from their monthly salary and placed into a charity pool. The participating employees are placed into a lucky draw that sees the winner donating the total of the pool to their chosen charity.
“The Chatsworth SCDIFA Cheshire Home took special care of my sister and winning the pool gives me the opportunity to give a little back,” he said. 
SUNCOAST Marketing Manager, Louise Howell, said they were privileged to be able to provide such an opportunity to staff. 

SCDIFA Cheshire Home is committed to providing accommodation and care to children living with severe mental and physical disabilities. The mission of Cheshire Homes includes providing everyone, irrespective of their challenges, with equal opportunities and care and to facilitate early identification of disabilities through assessments, care, counselling and interventions.
