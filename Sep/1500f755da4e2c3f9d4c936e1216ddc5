DURBAN - A year after eThekwini Municipality paid almost R20million for three Casspir armoured vehicles, the city still awaits their arrival.
The Casspirs were bought from state-owned arms manufacturer Denel in September last year to help metro police deal with riots more effectively.
The vehicles were meant to be delivered last November. However, to date, licensing issues appear to be the reason for the delay.
Metro police spokesperson Parboo Sewpersad said, “We are awaiting these permits which grants us permission to use the armoured vehicles on our roads. It is not clear as yet when this will come through.”
Denel spokesperson Pam Malinda said the vehicles were ready but could not be delivered until all the necessary approvals were obtained for dealing with controlled items.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

DA councillor Heinz De Boer, who questioned the purchase of the Casspirs at the time, said he still couldn’t make sense of the need for them, when there were far more important resources needed by metro police.
De Boer said metro police needed to increase its visibility and that at least another 1500 to 2000 members were required for this.
