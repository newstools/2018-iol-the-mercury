Durban - IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi and ANC head of elections Fikile Mbalula, will today descend on Mangosuthu University of Technology to drum up support for Sadesmo and Sasco respectively.

The IFP-aligned South African Democratic Students Movement (Sadesmo) and the ANC-aligned South African Students Congress (Sasco) will host these leaders in their respective rallies held at the Umlazi campus today.
The rallies are a last push by the two rival student formations gunning for a victory at the SRC elections to be held tomorrow.
Interestingly both rallies are dubbed Siyanqoba (We are winning) and both will start at 2.30pm at separate venues on campus
In a statement, the IFP said Buthelezi will be accompanied by IFP Youth Brigade National Chairperson Mkhuleko Hlengwa and leaders of SADESMO in MUT.  “The rally is set to strengthen the SADESMO SRC election campaign for 2018,” the IFP said in a statement.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

In its statement the ANC said “Mbalula will galvanise students behind the Progressive Youth Association banner ahead of the SRC elections”.
Also attending the Sasco rally will be FeesMustFall activist Mcebo Dlamini and Sasco president Asavela Mjajubana
Sasco will be hoping to make up for a recent loss it suffered at the Durban University of Technology where the EFF student command won all eight seats.
