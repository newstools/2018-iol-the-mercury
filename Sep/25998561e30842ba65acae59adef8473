Durban - The KZN Department of Health has hit back at what it called a skewed and exaggerated picture of oncology treatment services in the province.
The department was responding to comments made by the DA’s spokesperson for health, Dr Imran Keeka, in reference to a national department report on cancer treatment services made to the National Health Council in June. Keeka said he was deeply disturbed by the findings. 
The report looks at the waiting times for radiation oncology treatment at Addington, Grey’s and Inkosi Albert Luthuli Central (IALCH) hospitals as well as other cancer treatment centres around the country. 
According to the report, the estimated backlog at IALCH is 6012 patients, 1923 at Grey’s and 132 at Addington. “The reported backlog only continues to grow. It requires urgent intervention,” noted the report. 
It attributes this to “unacceptable waiting times” to non-functional equipment and inadequate staffing. 

Keeka blamed MEC Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo and the department for “providing no hope of addressing the lack of treatment and the resulting suffering of thousands of people”.
But this was rubbished by the department as “undermining efforts that have been made to restore cancer treatment services in the province”.
Poonitha Naidoo of the Medical Rights Advocacy Network said there needed to be long-term solutions to the problems in diagnosis, treatment, equipment and staff and on the academic side in relation to cancer.
