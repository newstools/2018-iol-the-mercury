Local rapper Cassper Nyovest hosted a CÃ®roc party at his house on Heritage Day and it was so lit that he had 'people's boyfriends calling' him the next day asking what happened.
The 'Doc Shebeleza' rapper knows how to have a good time, however, it was a tweet from a disgruntledÂ boyfriend that had tweeps shook.
Twitter user @Dj_Techzi posted that his girlfriend said goodbye to him at 5pmÂ on Monday, and told him that she was "not feeling well" â€” but then he discovered that she ditched him to attend the rapper's pool party â€” and said boyfriend also posted supporting pictures as evidence.Â

Nyovest saw the post, then quoteÂ tweeted it with "Ene thatâ€™s my car hey. This is bad. unlucky boy".


 



Nyovest then posted another tweet, revealing that @Dj_TechziÂ was not the "only unhappy guy" because several of the women who attended the party's boyfriends phoned him about what happened at the party, but he doesn't have the answers they're looking for.Â 

 




Mufasa along with other attendees shared some snaps of the party which looked like one hell of a lituation.Â
