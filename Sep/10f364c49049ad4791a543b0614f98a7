Durban - Durban has been named the fifth wealthiest city in Africa by Afr-Asia Bank’s 2018 Africa Wealth Report, which found that wealth held in the city totalled $55billion (R819bn).
Johannesburg and Cape Town were ranked at positions one and two respectively, while Pretoria was named the eighth wealthiest city.
Wealth held in Johannesburg amounted to $276bn, in Cape Town $155bn, and in Pretoria $48bn.
The report defines total wealth as the private wealth held by individuals living in each city. This includes assets such as property, cash, equities and business interests less liabilities. Government funds are excluded.
Durban was ranked the second most expensive city for residential property. The index tracks the square metre prices in selected prime 200m² to 400m² flats in each area.

The report, however, admits there is one limitation to this measure as it work wells on flats, but houses normally have gardens and additional land that is difficult to value.
According to the report, Lagoon Drive in uMhlanga averaged $2900 per square metre last year. Cape Town’s Bantry Bay and Clifton had the most expensive rate at $6100 a square metre.
“South African cities dominate the list. It should, however, be noted that residential prices in South Africa are coming under strain as the threat of land redistribution begins to sink in. The drought in Cape Town also had a negative impact on prices.”
The report covered 17 major African markets, but excluded Algeria, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zimbabwe because of a lack of reliable data.

Of all the countries surveyed, South Africa was found to be the wealthiest with a total wealth of $772bn. But it had one of the slowest wealth growth rates over 10 years from 2007 to last year.
In this period, the wealth growth rate in the country was only 2%, the second-worst after Egypt at -10%. Mauritius, during this time, had the highest wealth growth rate of 195%, far higher than the continental average of 13%.
