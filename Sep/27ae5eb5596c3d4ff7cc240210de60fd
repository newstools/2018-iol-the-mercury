Durban - Members of the Umkhonto we Sizwe Military Veterans Association (MKMVA) stormed the Mooi Mpofana Municipality on Monday demanding jobs.
They are expected to hold another meeting with the administrator on their demands before a full council meeting on Wednesday. 
This is the fourth municipality in the Midlands the veterans have stormed in the past few weeks. They carried out similar actions in Richmond and invaded council meetings in Msunduzi demanding jobs and tender opportunities.
MKMVA leader Mzo Kheswa said they would attend a council meeting today to address issues raised by members in Mooi River.

“We are against disruption of services and councillors are not supposed to get involved with employment. We also don’t believe the MKMVA should have jobs reserved for them, the whole community deserves equal opportunity,” he said. 
Spokesperson for the Department of Transport, Community Safety and Liaison Kwanele Ncalane said a team led by the premier’s office had been set up to deal with issues of veterans. 

The ANC could not be reached for comment.
