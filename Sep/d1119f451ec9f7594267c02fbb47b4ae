Durban - Police Minister Bheki Cele yesterday condemned vigilantism, telling University of Zululand students those who attacked and injured a suspect accused of the murder of a fellow student would be harshly dealt with. 
Cele was addressing hundreds of students at the university’s Walter Gcabashe Hall to raise concerns about their safety. 
They voiced their discontent when Cele said they would not escape arrest for attacking the murder suspect, 20, after he had allegedly stabbed and killed Sazi Ngubo at the campus residence on Sunday. The suspect is still in hospital. 
Cele visited the murder scene and described the incident as shocking and gruesome. 
“I went to the room and it is a mess, but that does not allow us to be vigilantes. I have instructed police to identify everyone on the video (of the students attacking the murder suspect),” he said.

A cellphone video was taken while students were attacking the suspect with sticks and stones soon after Ngubo’s murder. 
As students shouted at Cele, he told them: “I’m not going to stand here and lie to you. Whether you want to hear this or not, this shall be done.” 
Cele said the students had not taken the chance to hand the suspect over to the police. 
Ngubo, who is from Port Shepstone, was pursuing a Bachelor of Education degree. 

Students told Cele they had been pleading for tighter security for many years. They called for police officers to be allowed to patrol the institution. 
However, Cele said he was not comfortable with bringing police into the institution as that would “create a war-zone situation”. 
“You have to live in an environment conducive for you to study in peace,” he said.
