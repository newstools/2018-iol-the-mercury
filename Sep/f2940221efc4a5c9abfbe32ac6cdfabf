Durban - MEC for Economic Development, Tourism and Environmental Affairs, Sihle Zikalala said Durban being listed as one of the top five wealthiest cities in Africa shows that Durban is a city of the rise.

 Zikalala, who is currently in China leading a team of KZN investors on an investment attraction drive, was reacting to Afr-Asia Bank's 2018 Africa Wealth Report which named Durban as the fifth wealthiest city in Africa with a wealth of R819-billion.
 "We will not rest until we claim a spot in the top three," said Zikalala.

 “This latest listing as the fifth wealthiest city on the continent speaks volumes about the quality of investments in the city and the province of KwaZulu-Natal," he said.

 In the context of our own situation said Zikalala, it also imposes a responsibility to continue to grow the economy and “ensure that it is also distributed to as many people as possible.”

 Looking ahead, Zikalala said, the aim was to ensure that other cities as well in the province also benefited from the upsurge in wealth.
 "We have a strategy in place to woo investors into to areas such as Richards Bay, Port Sheptstone and Newcastle so that the economies of these towns also improve."
