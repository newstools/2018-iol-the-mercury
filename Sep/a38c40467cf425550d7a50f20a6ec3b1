Durban - An elderly woman had to be airlifted to hospital after she collapsed during her routine morning walk in Ballito, north of Durban.

IPSS Medical spokesperson, Paul Herbst, said the woman was seriously injured during the fall and sustained injuries to her face. 
“Our Advanced Life Support paramedic worked alongside Lenmed heart and stroke staff to stabilise the woman,” he said. 
The patient then had to be airlifted to the Lenmed eThekwini Hospital for further urgent care, Herbst said. 
In a separate incident in KwaDukuza, also north of Durban, a swimmer had to be airlifted to hospital after a near-drowning at Blythedale. 

Herbst said, yesterday, two swimmers had gotten into difficulty in the sea, before being assisted out of the water, by beach-goers. 
“Both swimmers were in a critical condition and advanced life support intervention was initiated by IPSS Medical Rescue and the Lenmed Paramedic which was in the area and responded to offer assistance,” he said.

Herbst said due the critical condition of the patients and limited access, the Black Eagle/IPSS Aeromedical helicopter was activated to airlift one of the patients to the Lenmed eThekweni Hospital for further care. 
“The second victim, who was also in a critical condition, was transported by road to a nearby hospital for the care she required,” Herbst said.
