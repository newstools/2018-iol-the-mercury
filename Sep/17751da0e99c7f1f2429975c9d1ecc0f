Durban - The family of an IFP activist who was gunned down in an ambush on Saturday, is pleading with those who may have information to come forward. 
Zakhele Mazibuko, who was the publicity secretary of the IFP in the uThukela district, was killed in an ambush while he was driving between Estcourt and Colenso just after leaving a party meeting in Estcourt.
At the time of his death, he was the occupational and health manager at the uThukela District municipality.
“It was not dark when he was shot there are people who might have witnessed the shooting and we would like them to assist so that the law can take its course,” said his sister Hilda Mazibuko.
She said the family was still in shock. “He never said he was facing any challenges at work or in the IFP. What we saw at the scene was painful. His car was pulled from the bushes and his body was soaked in blood. Those who got close said his face had been badly damaged in the shooting and his car was riddled with bullets,” she said. 

Mkhuleko Hlengwa, the IFP national spokesperson, said the party and the community of uThukela had been robbed of a “hard-working servant of the people. It is of serious and grave concern that the killing of politicians has become a permanent feature of KwaZulu-Natal”, he said.
SAPS spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele said a case of murder was opened at Estcourt police station. 
Mazibuko is the second IFP councillor to be killed this year and among scores of politicians killed in KwaZulu-Natal since 2011, which prompted premier Willies Mchunu to establish the Moerane Commission investigating political murders in October 2016. 
The ANC told the commission that according to calculations based on law enforcement reports, 80 politicians had been killed in the province since 2011.
