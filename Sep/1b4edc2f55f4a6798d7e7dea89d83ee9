Durban - Foreign shop owners in Durban are living in fear after arson attacks on businesses in Newlands and KwaDabeka last week.
They are terrified they could face violence similar to that inflicted on foreign shop owners in Soweto last week.
Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele said the Newlands attack happened on Friday morning. The shopkeeper was sleeping inside the shop when he noticed smoke coming in. He tried to get out, but the shop was locked. 
He shouted for help and people from the house in whose yard the container was located, doused the flames and released him. He suffered burns and was said to be recovering in hospital.
On Thursday, John Ashtal was attacked by armed men who broke into his shop in KwaDabeka. They robbed him of cash and cigarettes.

Ashtalâ€™s South African wife, who did not want to be named, said she believed it was a xenophobic attack.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
