Durban - President Cyril Ramaphosa today officially unveiled a statue of former statesman and struggle stalwart, Nelson Mandela at the United Nations General Assembly. 

Addressing the gathering, Ramaphosa said for the government and people of South Africa, the enthusiasm with which the international community has embraced the celebration of the centenary of the birth of Nelson Mandela, was truly humbling.
"The people of our country, united in their diversity, revere Nelson Mandela as the founding father of our democratic nation – whose life, sacrifices and extraordinary contribution to freedom continues to inspire successive generations. For those of us gathered here at the United Nations, Nelson Mandela will forever hold a special place in our hearts because of his dedication to the service of humanity and the promotion of peace throughout the world. The values by which he lived and to which he dedicated his life are universal. We are honoured and grateful that the Nelson Mandela Peace Summit has been convened in his memory," he said.
