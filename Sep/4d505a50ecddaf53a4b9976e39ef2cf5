Durban - The man who was allegedly behind the wheel when a vehicle crashed into a wall resulting in the death of two young women on Durban’s Botanic Gardens Road has been released on R4000 bail, the Sunday Tribune can reveal.
An actress from the e.TV drama Imbewu: The Seed, Owethu Enhle Gambushe and her friend, Samke Majola - both 22, died while two other passengers survived, including the driver, a 47-year-old man.
Gambushe landed a role on the drama series this year, where she played the role of Nonhlanhla. 
The driver, Obed Dube, appeared in the Durban Magistrates Court on Monday. 
At the time of his arrest which took place on the early hours of Saturday morning, provincial police said he would be charged with two counts of culpable homicide and driving under the influence. 
National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Natasha Kara confirmed on Wednesday that the man had been released on R4000 bail and said he would return to the Durban Magistrates Court on October 21. 
Kara said the man had been charged with two counts of culpable homicide and said the NPA was still investigating if it would formally charge him with a charge of driving under the influence.
Meanwhile, Gambushe is expected to be buried on Saturday with a funeral service expected to take place at uMlazi’s W section.
