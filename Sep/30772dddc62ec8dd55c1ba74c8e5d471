Durban - The family of slain petrol-station owner Kidesh Ramjettan is hoping their R50 000 reward for any information on the businessman’s murder will bring some closure.
Ramjettan, 37, owner of Glazer Motors on South Coast Road, was shot dead while talking to a customer in the garage’s courtyard last month.
His uncle and family spokesperson, Prethumb Bechen, said the investigation into the murder was slow and the family was struggling with his death. 
“After all the necessary prayers were done, the family had time to do a deep introspection on what could be the reason for Kidesh’s murder. They couldn’t come up with anything as he was well-loved, a family man and respected businessman and no one would have reason to do this. We then decided to put up the reward,” he said. 
Bechen said Ramjettan’s elderly parents’ health has since deteriorated and his 80-year-old mother had to be sedated to cope with her youngest son’s death. Ramjettan’s father, Balraj, continuously views footage of the shooting and cries, he said.

On August 23, a man walked up to Ramjettan, shot him in the back of the head and ran off. Anybody with information can contact Warrant Officer Rajen Nagaser on 083 795 1295.
