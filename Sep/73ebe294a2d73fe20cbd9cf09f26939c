Durban - Busisiwe Mdletshe has to fork out an extra R82 to get to and from work each day now that the train services have been suspended. Mdletshe, who takes care of two children and cleans the house for a family living in Manor Gardens, previously spent R170 on a train ticket from Ezimbokodweni near Umgababa on the KwaZulu-Natal south coast to work.

The mother of four, who also looks after her four grandchildren said she now has to take three minibus taxis from home to get to work.
“Before I would take the train and get off at the Durban station. From there, I would take a taxi to Manor Gardens. Now I have to take a taxi to Isipingo then to town and finally get to my place of work just after 8am,” she said. 
From her R2850 wages, Mdletshe spends R320 a month travelling from Ezimbokodweni to Manor Gardens.
Mdletshe is just one of hundreds of commuters who had to seek alternate travel arrangements after train services were suspended this week. 

The suspension of services comes after a station and Metro Rail vehicles were set alight in uMlazi last Friday. It is alleged that a group of commuters torched the infrastructure and cars, after the train ran a little later than scheduled.
According to the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) regional spokesperson, Zama Nomnganga, said they were working on a plan to reinstate services, however the decision to suspend services was indefinite to ensure the safety of both staff and commuters. 
The Mercury previously reported that two trains were set alight at the Durban and Berea stations. This act of vandalism costed Metro Rail and Prasa almost R10 million. 
Earlier this year, Prasa officials said they had incurred R442m in losses in the past financial year due to natural and criminal damage.
