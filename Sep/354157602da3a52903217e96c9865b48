Durban - Durban University of Technology management has noted the demands made in a Memorandum of Understanding handed over by students following protest at the campuses earlier this week.

In a statement, DUT revealed that they fully accepted the demands put forward by the Student Representative Council and further discussions would be required in order for a consensus to be reached.
Senior Director of Corporate Affairs at DUT, Alan Khan, said both parties have agreed that SBux payment issues and the late registration requests, required further discussion in order for all parties to reach a consensus.
“A comprehensive plan of action for these issues ,which seeks to find lasting solutions, was also discussed.  
Furthermore, all parties agreed that the Vice-Chancellor and Principal of DUT, Professor Thandwa Mthembu will engage with the NSFAS administrator immediately, to request an urgent investigation of the anomalies and discrepancies in the disbursed allowances to NSFAS funded students,” he said.

Khan added that Professor Mthembu was also mandated to request that the NSFAS Administrator deploy a team of senior officials with decision-making powers to urgently visit DUT and to empower the NSFAS team to resolve issues - that the DUT Financial Aid officials cannot resolve, due to the centralised NSFAS system.
Khan added that more engagements will be arranged in the near future to discuss other issues that the SRC had tabled in the meeting.
