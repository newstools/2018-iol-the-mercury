Durban - The murderers of Musgrave mother and retired school teacher Shakila Singh walked down the steps and into the cells below the Durban High Court before being ferried off to prison to begin their life sentences on Friday morning.
Amon Ngongi and Ally Jumar Abdullah were also sentenced to 15 years for robbery, as was Nonjabulo Mteki who had been Singh’s trusted domestic worker for years. Mteki was the person the Singh family believed was the mastermind behind the robbery.

Singh was murdered in her home in September 2016. 
Judge Bert Laing said he found no compelling reason not to hand out the minimum sentences and said that Mteki was not found guilty of murder because he gave her the benefit of the doubt. However, she had assisted the murderers and afterwards helped in the effort to cover their tracks.

While she is local, Ngongi and Abdullah are both Tanzanians who claimed to be refugees.
“This country provided you with the opportunity to start your lives over again. In return you have taken the life of someone who made this possible and contributed to the fiscus to make to have this opportunity,” the judge said.
