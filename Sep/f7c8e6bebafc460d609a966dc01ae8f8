DURBAN - Ten University of KwaZulu-Natal students will receive bursaries funded by money raised by the ‘R67 for Mandela Month’ campaign.

In July, the UKZN Foundation reached out to the public to donate money on Mandela Day which would raise funds for bursaries.
With help from the Durban Chamber of Commerce and Industry and East Coast Radio as a media partner, the message was spread far and wide.
“Initially the campaign started with emails, social media and websites building up to the live broadcast on East Coast Radio on July 18, marking the 100th birth anniversary of the late president  Nelson Mandela. The broadcast ultimately raised R89 000, and donations trickled in to R102 000 on August 6. The DCCI messages reached more than 2 million people around the globe in three weeks.  The final amount raised by the campaign was R366 840,” said UKZN spokesperson Indumathie Moodley.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
Now ten students from the ‘missing middle’ who are unable to qualify to financial aid but still cannot pay university fees, will receive partial bursaries towards their studies. 

An official function will take place on Tuesday with guest speakers, where the bursaries will be handed over to the students.
