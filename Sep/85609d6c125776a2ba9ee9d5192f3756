Durban - Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga yesterday praised the National Teachers Union (Natu) for protecting the institution of teaching.
Motshekga was addressing hundreds of Natu members at its centenary celebrations hosted at the University of Zululand.
“It has been 100 years of fighting, 100 years of promoting excellence in basic education, and 100 years of sweet victories. Natu has survived an avalanche of onslaught on basic education in this country. The turbulence began with the segregation of the 1920s, the closure of missionary schools, and the Bantu Education Act, among others,” she said.
She said that in the last 24 years, Natu had played a pivotal role during the epoch of democratisation of basic education in the country. 
“We do not always agree, but we have always appreciated your honesty and robustness,” she said. “There’s one thing that has stood Natu in good stead over the last 10 decades and that is the love and care for your profession. You fought gallantly against the segregation, Bantu Education Act during the days of the apartheid regime.”AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
