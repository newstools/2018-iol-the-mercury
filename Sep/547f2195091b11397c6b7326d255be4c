Durban - She scored 39 distinctions for her Master's Degree in Chiropractic and for Dr Johmari Logtenberg it means freedom and new beginnings. 

Logtenberg, 29, graduated from the Durban University of Technology. 
“During my six-and-half years of studying there were plenty of occasions where I just thought about this day and whether it would ever actually happen," said Logtenberg. 
She added:  “I took my studies very serious. I knew that one day patients would be placing their health in my hands, thus I wanted to ensure that I’m as prepared as I can be."AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
Since completing her studies, she has opened up her own private chiropractic practice in Tzaneen, Limpopo. 

She said since school she has enjoyed the sciences. 
“At school, I always enjoyed biology and learning about the anatomy and physiology of the human body, so from an early age, I knew I wanted to study something in the medical field. 
"I also represented South Africa in table tennis, cricket and golf, so I wanted to study something in the medical field which allows you to work with sportsmen and women and contribute towards their performances and their careers. Also having a sister who already graduated as a Chiropractor in 2009 helped me realise the difference chiropractors can make in people’s lives,” she said.
She said despite enduring various challenges during her studies including borrowing money from her parents to fund her research project and taking four months to find examiners to mark her thesis, she always looked at the bigger picture and kept on persevering.

She also encouraged students to persevere and work hard in order to achieve their goals.
