Durban - The Umbilo Motor Vehicle Licensing offices will be closed until next week.
The KwaZulu-Natal Department of Transport said that the station would be temporarily closed until Friday next week as workers carry out repairs after the premises was robbed on Tuesday.
“The robbery caused significant damage to the infrastructure where we service our customers. 
“The department would like to apologise for any inconvenience caused to members of the public,” said Transport Department spokesperson Mluleki Mtungwa.
“At this stage, the police investigations are ongoing. We still do not know what was destroyed and what was taken,” he said. Mtungwa said while the repairs were being conducted, members of the public should go to the Motor Licensing office in Morningside, in Smiso Nkwanyana (Goble) Road, or any post office in eThekwini.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

SAPS Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said at about 5am on Tuesday, a group of 10 men forced their way into the licensing centre and held up security guards.
“It is alleged that the suspects used explosives to open a safe. It has not yet been established what they took from the safe. Police are investigating a case of robbery,” she said. 
She said no arrests had been made yet.
