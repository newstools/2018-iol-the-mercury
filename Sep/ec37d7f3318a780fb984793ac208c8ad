Durban - Teachers' union NAPTOSA has condemned alleged violent attacks on teachers in the classroom, the most recent being the death of a teacher in the North West province, allegedly at the hands of a pupil. 
 

 Thirona Moodley, of NAPTOSA KZN, said no teacher will be productive if they are teaching with the fear of reprisals. 

 

 She said teachers on a daily basis faced a myriad of challenges. 

 

 "In the recent past, their safety and security at the workplace add to the burden. The recent death of an educator in the North West has once again highlighted the daily plight of teachers in the classroom.

 Moodley said learner on teacher assault was not a new phenomenon in the country. 

 

 "In KZN several such incidents have been reported to NAPTOSA... we cannot be accepting of the fact that the violence of society reflects in the school." 

 

 She appealed for teachers to engage with the school governing body and representative council learners to condemn pupil on teacher violence. 

 

 Moodley urged teachers to report any incident to SAPS.

 

 A 17-year-old is expected to appear in court today in connection with the death of the teacher.
