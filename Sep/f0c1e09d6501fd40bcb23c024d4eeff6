It's no secret that Priyanka Chopra and Duchess Meghan have been friends for years, so it comes as no surprise that they have things in common.Â 
 

 Priyanka, who recently announced her engagement to singer Nick Jonas, also attended her close friend's royal wedding in May, when Meghan married Britain's Prince Harry.

 

 Meghan and Harry announced their engagement in NovemberÂ and shared their official engagement photographs captured by Alexi Lubomirski soon after.Â

 The same photographer was commissioned to cover Ralph Lauren 50th Anniversary fashion show as part of New York Fashion Week on Friday, an event attended by many celebrity A-listers, among them Priyanka and Nick.

 

 Lubomirski snatched up the opportunity to capture the newly-engaged couple at the event, in a pose that has been likened to Harry and Meghan's engagement snap.Â 

 

 Taking to Instagram, Lubomirski shared the picture of the couple with the caption: "@priyankachopraÂ atÂ @ralphlaurenÂ 50thÂ anniversaryÂ show last night inÂ #NYFW........ What an amazing honour to get to photograph all these amazing people in one night! Thank you Ralph and all the team!!!"

 Fans instantly noticed the similarities in the pose, with some criticising Lubomirski for "trying to create" the royal couple's pose.Â 

 

 One user wrote: "shame on you for trying to recreate the photos of the wonderful Royals. Very tacky. Loved photos of Harry and Meghan but all you are going to do is set off a shit storm with debates on who looked better and who is better which has already happened. No one compares to the integrity and beauty of Harry and Meghan though (sic)"

 

 While others slammed the critics for being petty: "I
 t absolutely kills me how many people get so butt hurt over a damn pose! Are you kidding me?! Seriously, like nobody has ever had the same pose before! Damn, get over it or just keep scrolling! It's a STUNNING photo of two BEAUTIFUL people (sic).
