Durban - The University of Zululand has condemned the violent attack that has rocked its KwaDlangezwa campus at the weekend. 

On Sunday, videos emerged of a student being attacked by fellow students following a fatal stabbing. 
The Mercury reported earlier that two students were heard arguing just minutes before the stabbing.

Nhleko-Mdluli said university leadership has also taken swift and decisive action by initiating an independent investigation.

“This will unravel facts surrounding the incidents as the details are not clear at the moment. The university has also taken note that the matter is under the full police investigation. The university community is urged to allow these processes to proceed unhindered,” Nhleko-Mdluli said.
The student who allegedly stabbed the now deceased man, is believed to be in hospital under police guard. It is unclear what charges he is set to face. 
Meanwhile, many have taken to Twitter to express their sentiments over both the murder of the student and the attack on the alleged perpetrator.
