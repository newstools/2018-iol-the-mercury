Local rapper Cassper Nyovest got dragged through the Twitter streets twice in less than 24 hours, and the latest incident saw Economic Freedom Fighter (EFF) party leader Julius Malema taking shots too.
 

 Twitter slammed the "Get Getsa 2.0" singer on Wednesday after he shared the news that his childhood friend had committed suicide, highlighting that depression is real. 




 But tweeps turned his words against him, asking the rapper when he last reached out to his friend. While others accused the rapper of using his friend's death to fish for likes.

 Then on Thursday, "Cassper" and "FillUp" started trending. This usually happens when "Abuthi Fill Up" is promoting one of his concerts. However, this time it was because Nyovest allegedly issued Tsonga star,  Benny Mayengani, with a "cease and desist" order for trademark infringement after the rapper used the #FillUp hashtag to promote his Giyani Stadium concert.

 


 
 


 Malema then took to Twitter, pledging his support for Mayengani. He wrote: We will defend you chief @BennyMayengani, don't be scared of bullies who are threatened by talent. We have the best in town, let them bring it on. #FillUpGiyaniStadium". 




 The support post comes after Malema shared a video of Mayengan's concert on Sunday. The post is currently pinned at the top Malema's official Twitter account timeline.

 


 
 


 

 After Malema weighed in on the matter, the hashtag #JuliusHandsOffCassper was born, as fans rallied behind Nyovest.


 
 



 
 


 Speaking to Metro FM on Thursday afternoon, Nyovest explained that he had the term trademarked a year ago.
