Durban - Violence has flared up again in the community of Kranskop with angry locals setting alight a bus and demanding that action be taken against a farmer who allegedly desecrated graves. 

This morning, residents claimed that it had been a month since they laid criminal charges against farmer, Carl Gathmann, who they accuse of destroying graves belonging to their forefathers. Gathmann was previously denied the allegations levelled against him.
Residents said they have opened at least 27 cases against Gathmann in August but nothing has happened since.

Yenga said the roadway has been closed and residents set a bus alight. 
"I have not gone to the area because I cannot, I do not have the answers that they are looking for,” he said.
