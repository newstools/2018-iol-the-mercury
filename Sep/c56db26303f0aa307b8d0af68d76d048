Durban - The transition from the classroom to the workplace is never an easy one and finding job experience opportunities can be daunting for young graduates.
Recognising the needs of graduates, particularly from Further Education and Training (FET) colleges, Musgrave based business International Management & HR Solutions (IMHR) has for the past two years facilitated internships with the Saantha Naidu Group (SNG).
The group owns Coastlands Hotels in Musgrave, the CBD and uMhlanga, as well as the Royal Hotel in Durban.
IMHR’s Jean Naidoo, who found the company and is co-director with Dinesh Naidoo of Serendipity World Wide Group, said: “We most definitely owe our youth a successful life, therefore IMHR creates this opportunity for business to collaborate with us to contribute to uplifting young graduates.” 
Last week, a graduation ceremony was held for 45 students who had completed their 18-month training with SNG.

Some of them will be offered permanent positions. One of the graduates, Sadie Govender, said she had secured a permanent job as a chef. 
“I would like to thank IMHR; the Services Seta and the SNG for giving me this opportunity to complete my 18-month internship.
“I completed my training in the various departments in the hotel and found myself excelling in the kitchen as a chef; so much so that I was offered permanent employment as a chef.” 
In a statement, SNG Group HR administrator and skills development facilitator, Sheik Ebrahim, said Coastlands was committed to skills development and since tourism and hospitality is a big role player in the country’s economy, it was important to train graduates so they can obtain work in the industry.

He said Coastlands has over 500 interns within its hotels serving 6, 12 and 18-month internships with various institutions.
He added that the group of graduates was the second group from the Services Seta that was managed by IMHR for the duration of 18 months.
