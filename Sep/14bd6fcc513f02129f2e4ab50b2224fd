Durban - The bus driver of the Intercape international coach which crashed in Limpopo, killing nine people, has been arrested as he tried to flee to Zimbabwe.
“The police in Westenburg, outside Polokwane, have arrested the driver of the bus involved in the horrific accident. He tried to cross the border into Zimbabwe after he was taken to hospital with 51 injured passengers for medical treatment,” said Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe, Limpopo provincial police spokesperson.
Ngoepe said the driver fled after being discharged from hospital.
“The police were then tipped off. They swiftly responded and the driver was caught hidden inside a goods trailer trying to illegally cross the border to Zimbabwe,” he said.
The driver will appear in the Polokwane Magistrate's Court today on charges of culpable homicide. 

“His arrest follows a culpable homicide (case) where nine passengers lost their lives during a bus crash, which occurred along the N1 South road, in the early hours of Friday. 
"It is alleged that the bus was travelling to Gauteng when the driver lost control and it overturned,” said Ngoepe.
There were 61 people on the bus, including the driver and crew.
Intercape bus company released a statement on Twitter saying that it was co-operating with the ongoing investigations. 

Meanwhile, wet and rainy conditions over the long weekend created havoc on KwaZulu-Natal roads and led to two people being killed.
On Friday, one person was killed when a taxi caught alight, after a collision with a lorry. 
Netcare 911 spokesperson Shawn Herbst said the crash happened on the M1 near Mariannhill and also left another person critically injured. 
A person was killed and five others injured on the M19, near Blair Atholl Road in Westville, on Saturday. 

Rescue Care’s Garrith Jamieson said a woman sustained major injuries in the accident and was declared deceased on the scene.
