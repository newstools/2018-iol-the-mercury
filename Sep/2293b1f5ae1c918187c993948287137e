Johannesburg - President Cyril Ramaphosa has told Parliament he will appear before the Zondo Commission of Inquiry into state capture if asked to do so by the commission.

Ramaphosa told the National Council of Provinces on Tuesday that he had no problem with appearing before the commission. The DA has been pushing for him to give evidence.
The party said he was deputy to former president Jacob Zuma when the allegations of state capture occurred.

“The issue of state capture is a matter that has affected all of us in the country. What is revealed in the Zondo Commission is coming as a shock and surprise,” said Ramaphosa. 

“As far as I am concerned, if the Zondo commission asks me to appear before it, I have no difficulty. It is important for the people of South Africa to get to know what has happened in the state. As you cite the ANC part of it, it was the ANC that asked for the commission.
“When the Zondo Commission seeks our participation, we will go there.” However, it is unclear when the commission will resume as it was postponed on Tuesday until further notice.
The commission was meant to sit on Wednesday to hear evidence from former Public Enterprises Minister Barbara Hogan. The commission’s spokesman Mbuyiselo Stemela said he would issue a statement on Wednesday regarding the programme moving forward.
