Durban - In response to the call for the nationalisation of Sasol by local social injustice group People Against Petrol and Paraffin Price Increases (Papppi) last week, chemicals and energy company Sasol said that as a privately owned company it could not be nationalised. Sasol spokesperson Matebello Motloung said: “Nationalisation of privately-held companies is not part of the current government’s policy.”

The price of fuel, added Motloung, was regulated by the government.
On Monday,  Energy Minister Jeff Radebe said there would be 4.9c/litre increase to cater for the annual salary increase for forecourt attendants, cashiers and other staff. 
PAPPPI believes that South Africans should not pay more than R10 for Sasol fuel and has called for the boycott of all Sasol garages.
“You should not be filling up there until Sasol is able to bring their prices down,” he said.

Radebe said South Africa has witnessed sustained increases in fuel prices for the past few months, which placed a strain on the consumers.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
“Despite the fact that these increases were caused mainly by international factors, the department has decided to intervene temporarily for this month. This is a once off temporary intervention to provide some relief to motorists and consumers against fuel price hikes,” he said.
