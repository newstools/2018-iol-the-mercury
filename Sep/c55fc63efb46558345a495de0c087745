DURBAN - Glenwood High School’s principal has received a doctorate in philosophy. The school said the principal, Andri Barnes, had received the qualification this week from the University of KwaZulu-Natal.
Her PhD thesis was titled “Teenage Boys’ Constructions of Masculinities”. 
Barnes took the helm of the historic all-boys school in the middle of the year. She is the school's first woman principal in the school's 108 year history.
Barnes joined the staff at Glenwood High School 21 years ago. She has held the post of head of department for history for many of these years.
For 10 years she was the deputy principal, followed by a period as the acting principal. She is an alumna of the University of the Orange Free State where she studied high school teaching.
Barnes’ appointment came shortly after that of Andrew Graaf, who became Pietermaritzburg Girls’ High School's first male principal.
