Durban - A foreign national is in a critical condition after he was doused with petrol and set alight in Ashburton near Pietermaritzburg on Sunday afternoon. 

A passing motorist called local authorities after he discovered the man lying at the side of the road with burn wounds. 
ER24 paramedics who were called on scene said the man apparently managed to extinguish the flames himself.
“Upon arrival, paramedics found that the man had sustained serious burns over most of his body, leaving him in a critical condition,” said ER spokesperson Russel Meiring. 
The man was treated for his injuries and provided with advanced life support before being transported to Edendale Hospital in Pietermaritzburg. AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

“The complainant alleged that he was kidnapped by four unknown suspects from Durban and they poured petrol on him,” said KZN police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane.
A case of attempted murder is being investigated by Alexandra Road SAPS in Pietermaritzburg.
