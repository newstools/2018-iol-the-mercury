Durban - The mother of a metro police officer killed in a hit-and-run accident will not accept an apology from the woman responsible for his death because it is “six years too late”. 
This was how Nonhlanhla Mbatha reacted after Magistrate Siphiwe Hlophe ordered Nolwazi Nzimande, 30, to write a letter of apology to the Mbatha family.
In April, Nzimande was convicted of culpable homicide. 
Phumlani Mbatha, 26, was off duty when Nzimande struck him with her car in April 2012. She did not stop. Paramedics took him to hospital but he died the next day. 
Nzimande’s co-accused, John Solomon, was convicted of attempting to obstruct the course of justice by arranging for Nzimande’s car to be towed to a panel beater. 

During sentencing in the Durban Regional Court yesterday, Nzimande and Solomon were fined R3 000 each or six months in prison for obstruction of justice, while Nzimande was also fined R5 000 or one year for failing to perform the duties of a driver after a collision.

Nzimande was sentenced to five years in prison, which was wholly suspended for five years. 
Hlophe said Nzimande’s actions had a profound impact on the Mbatha family.
“Such conduct warrants serious condemnation and a severe sentence.”

Mbatha said she was disappointed Nzimande had escaped a jail term but was more hurt by her arrogant demeanour.
