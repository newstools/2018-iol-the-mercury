Durban - The failure to settle a R1 200 petrol bill immediately after filling up has left the deputy mayor of the uThukela District Municipality with an egg on her face, as her vehicle was seized by the petrol station at the weekend.
The Mercury learnt through various sources that Nombali Sibiya’s official car, a Toyota Fortuner, had been kept at a Shell garage in Ladysmith since Friday afternoon, and only released on Sunday after payment was received.
Witnesses said Sibiya’s driver had tried to use the municipality’s petrol card to pay for petrol, but the payment was declined.
“There were four people in the car and they had to call someone to come and pick them up,” said a witness.
The incident comes a week after the cash-strapped municipality was placed under administration by Co-operative Governance MEC Nomusa Dube, who cited “the financial liquidity of this municipality” as one of the main reasons for the intervention. 

While Sibiya confirmed the incident, she said it had nothing to do with the municipality’s financial woes.
“Clearly, someone is trying to create a story where there is none. 
“The problem was that the card had expired. 
“I was not there when that happened. I don’t know why they say I was there. On Sunday, I arranged for a cash payment rather than wait for officials to come back to work on Monday,” she said.

The deputy mayor’s version of events was corroborated by the municipality’s spokesperson, Jabulani Mkhonza. 
While admitting the municipality had been placed under administration, Mkhonza said there were no major cash-flow problems.
“We are working normally. Salaries are being paid on time,” he said.
Some employees told The Mercury they were paid late last month.

Mkhonza said system glitches had led to some employees receiving their salaries a few hours later than normal.
“Service providers are being paid on time, but sometimes we have the usual hiccups associated with the supply chain,” he said.
