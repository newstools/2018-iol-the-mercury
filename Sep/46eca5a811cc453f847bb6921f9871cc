Durban - THE University of Zululand student who was killed at the university last weekend has been laid to rest.

The student, Sazi Ngubo, 20, was buried in Port Shepstone on Saturday. Ngubo was allegedly killed by a fellow student during a heated argument last weekend. 
The murder-accused Sibonakaliso Mbatha, 25, appeared in absentia at the Mtunzini Magistrates Court. He remains under police guard at a hospital after being assaulted by students.
Ngubo was just one of three students killed at KZN universities this week, with incidents at the University of KwaZulu-Natal and the Durban University of Technology. 
At UKZN, BCom student Nqabani Nkanyiso Dlomo, 23, was killed in the early hours of Saturday morning after attending the 'Mother of all bashes' at the Westville campus. He is expected to be buried on Saturday at his Matimatolo homestead in Greytown.

Dlomo was an active ANC Youth League member at the time of his passing. 
Fellow student Sibongiseni Dladla, 21, also from Greytown, has been charged with Dlomo's murder. He appeared at the Pinetown Magistrate's Court this week and will appear again on Tuesday for a formal bail application. 
Meanwhile at the Durban University of Technology, another ANCYL member was shot dead near the students residence in Albert Park last Friday.
