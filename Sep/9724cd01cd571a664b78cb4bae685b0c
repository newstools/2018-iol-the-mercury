Durban - Consumers are not necessarily going to feel the pinch of the technical recession which the country has slipped into, experts have said.
Earlier this week it was announced that the country had entered a technical recession, having posted negative economic growth for two consecutive quarters. The government yesterday called for calm, saying it was working on a plan to pull the country out of the situation.
Mervyn Abrahams of the Pietermaritzburg Economic Justice and Dignity Group said ordinary people were already in an affordability crisis, partly due to the currency fluctuations.
“Technical recessions are technical; it is a data thing, it doesn’t always find its way into the lives of ordinary people,” he said.
Professor Bonke Dumisa, an economist, was also of the view that, while people in some sectors will be affected, not everyone will feel the impact of the technical recession.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

“There is really no need to panic. Technical recessions are not necessarily felt directly by the man on the street. However, you might find that people in sectors that are showing a decline might feel the pinch. For example, seasonal workers in the agricultural sector in the Western Cape or people who are employed as casual employees in the hospitality sector might find that those casual jobs are now limited,” he said.
Dumisa pointed out, however, that last year the country did slip into a technical recession in the second quarter and that two ratings agencies, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch, had downgraded the country’s credit while Moody’s did not. 
He said the real danger would be if Moody’s were to also downgrade South Africa, which would lead to borrowing costs rising and this may affect the repo rate.
Clif Johnston of the South African National Consumer Union said jobs may be at stake and that is where the recession may hurt.

His advice to consumers was to try be prudent with their spending.
