Durban - Despite being granted bail last week, the main suspect in the alleged kidnapping of 10-year-old Miguel Louw is still in custody.
Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said Mohammed Ebrahim had not paid the bail money, which was why he was still in custody.
“No, bail has not been cancelled, he simply has not paid it. Bail can only be cancelled if a person violated their bail conditions,” Mbhele said.
Mbhele said the police were still awaiting DNA results to confirm whether the body found on Monday afternoon was indeed that of Miguel, who has been missing since July 17.
