Durban - The Msunduzi Municipality’s corporate services unit allegedly spent close to R4 million on overtime pay - almost five times more than what had been budgeted for.
DA councillor Sibongiseni Majola said an amount of R600 000 for the year had been budgeted for overtime. Opposition parties in the council have demanded that the unit, which is being accused of abusing overtime payment, be investigated.
“This unit was made up of legal services and human resources before it was moved into the municipal manager’s office. The staff there work normal hours from 8am to 4pm, so it is hard to explain this overtime,” said Majola.
He said they were also concerned that the municipality continued to under-spend on its budget for staff expenditure, as that meant there were vacant positions. Almost every business unit had under-spent. 
“There is an unemployment crisis in our city, and by failing to make the appointments, we are denying the youth of the city an opportunity. Most importantly, the finance department is among those that have underspent. There are already complaints about billing. This city has a debtors book of about R3 billion, and with vacancies in finance, that means we are not sending people to read meters and collect those debts,” he said.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

Msunduzi mayor Themba Njilo said the overtime issue was not a crisis. 
“After the approval of the cost-containment measures, the overtime undergoes a pre-approval process by general managers, in cases of normal overtime, and by the municipal managers, in cases of emergency overtime.” 
He said they were in the process of filling vacancies. 
“Departments have until the end of today to finalise their priority posts for advertising in October. The plan is to advertise quarterly to address the issue of vacancies,” Njilo said.
