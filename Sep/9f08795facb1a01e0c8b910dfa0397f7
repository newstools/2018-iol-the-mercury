Durban - Further witness statements are to be collected before the case of murder against the president of the National Funeral Practitioners Association in SA (NFPASA),continues. 

Muzi Hlengwa, appeared before the Durban Magistrates Court yesterday, on charges of murder, attempted murder, theft of a cell phone and kidnapping. 
These relate to the death of Thanduxolo Mkhize, who Hlengwa previous told The Mercury was a “known whoonga addict and troublemaker”. Hlengwa claimed that Mkhize had broken into his home several times. He said he had last seen the deceased surrounded by a mob of community members fed-up of Mkhize and his accomplices whoonga-fueled break ins.
Hlengwa is also accused of assaulting Nkululeko “Chappies” Latha with the intent to kill him. According to court papers, Latha was beaten with a sjambok, knobkerries and sticks. His hands were allegedly bound with cable ties when he was placed into a vehicle and taken to KwaMashu from Chesterville. Here he was tied to a steel bar and assaulted. 
Following Hlengwa handing himself over to police, he was granted R2 000 bail. 

The court had granted him bail after considering that he has no pending or previous convictions was not a flight risk and would not interfere with witnesses. In his affidavit Hlengwa said he was self employed and employed 15 people at his funeral parlour. 
Hlengwa, who is represented by a private attorney, intends on pleading not guilty to the charges.  
Nafupa came under the spotlight when it’s members attempted to block non-black businesses from conducting burials in townships as part of economic transformation.
