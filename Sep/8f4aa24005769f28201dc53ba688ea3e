Former foundation CEO Donne Nicole said of Maboya: “Mmabatho has contributed immensely to the Foundation’s mission in driving programmes that contribute to the socio-economic development of our country”.
 She said she was a worthy successor as she had driven the foundation in key sectors and industries, enabling her to direct the foundation’s strategic alignment with multi-sector networks. 
“I have no doubt that she will continue to grow the organisation and make the necessary impact for our people” said Nicol.
Maboya said the work the foundation did created opportunities and changed many lives.  
“We have through our 14 years of existence developed tried and tested models that make a sustainable difference. With the continued support of our partners, as well as new ones, we effect real and meaningful change for disadvantaged school communities, tertiary students and Black entrepreneurs. I am honoured to be afforded the opportunity to lead this remarkable organisation,” she said.
Maboya said Nicola had led and realised the foundation’s value by upholding strong values during her tenure.
