Cape Town - Government has cautioned the public to remain calm and refrain from taking the law into their own hands after the rape of a 7-year-old girl at a Dros restaurant in Pretoria.
 

 On Thursday night, the South African government tweeted an appeal for the public to refrain from circulating a graphic video purportedly showing the child's alleged attacker being violently confronted at the restaurant. The bleeding man can be heard protesting his innocence and insisting that he was just using the toilet. 

 

 The government went on to say that it was outraged by the incident and that sharing the video was insensitive to the child and could impact negatively on the prosecution of her attacker.

 


 
 


 


 
 


 

 The incident, which has shocked people across South Africa, took place in the men's toilet of the Dros restaurant in Silverton last Saturday.

 

 Earlier on Thursday, members of #NotInMyName SA campaign visited the restaurant and vowed to shut it down if management failed to deliver on promises made to the victim's family, which included covering medical costs for the little girl.
