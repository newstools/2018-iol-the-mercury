Durban - The KwaZulu Natal MEC Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta), Nomusa Dube-Ncube has condemned the burning of the Vumengazi Traditional Court in Umlazi on Monday morning. 

KZN police spokesman, Colonel Thembeka Mbele, said about 300 community members embarked in a protest action where they blockaded the road with burning tyres. 
"They also set alight the Tribal Court. The police attended the scene and the angry mob also stoned the state vehicle. A case of public violence has been opened for investigation."
Mbele said no arrests were made by Monday afternoon. 
Dube-Ncube said from what they were told the community was protesting against water shortages in the area. AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

"It does not make sense to then burn the traditional court which will not bring water. We have on numerous occasions appealed to our communities to not destroy infrastructure when they have grievances, we have urged them to follow proper channels to air their grievances."
She appealed to people to desist from doing this and called on law enforcement agencies to make an example out of the perpetrators of his heinous act. 
“The traditional court was also home to a soup kitchen that caters for the needy within the community. As a result of this violent service delivery protest families that were relying on this soup kitchen have nothing to eat. The current economic climate is such that government resources are stretched as we have to do more with less and this act of criminality is denying members of this community access to important service that was rendered by the traditional court," concluded Dube-Ncube.
