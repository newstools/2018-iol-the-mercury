Durban - A fake Facebook profile of Minister of Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) Dr Zweli Mkhize has been described as “mischievous” by the ministry.
However, by late Monday afternoon, the page had already garnered more than 450 friends.
In a statement, the ministry said it condemned the fraudulent and mischievous use of Mkhize’s profile, name and photographs.
Spokesman Legadima Leso confirmed Mkhize did not have a personal Facebook account and was only active on one social media platform.
“The minister is reachable on social media through his twitter account: @DrZweliMkhize or through the CoGTA social media platforms - @NationalCoGTA (Twitter) and National CoGTA (Facebook),” he said.

The fake profile, which is still active online, has a picture of Mkhize’s ministerial convoy while the cover photo is of the minister dancing behind former president Jacob Zuma at a rally.
Other photos include Mkhize with Zuma and President Cyril Ramaphosa, an image of Mkhize being interviewed on a news channel and Mkhize with his deputy, John Jeffery, at a media briefing.
The fake profile also has a description of Mkhize under the social media platform’s “intro” section.
Leso said the account communicated professional aspects linked to Mkhize’s portfolio and other private information.

The ministry has requested the profile be removed with urgency.
