Durban - The countdown to the Sunflower Fund Fun Run/Walk has reached it's last few hours. On Sunday, hundreds of locals are expected to take part in the annual event that raises funding and awareness about the work done by the Sunflower Fund. 

The Sunflower Fund in KZN will be holding a mobile donor drive and is appealing to the public to further register as a stem cell donor at the event and give the hope of life to affected patients.

Those who still want to register can make their way down to the Pick n Pay Customer Service Desks at Cornubia, Durban North Hyper, La Lucia, Pavilion and Umhlanga Crescent on Saturday, 15 September between 10am and 5pm. Registration will also take place at the Suncoast Amphitheatre on Saturday from 1pm to 3pm and on Sunday from 7:30am to 9am. The entry fee is R60 and includes a 2018 Sunflower DayTope (Tube of Hope).
