Cape Town - A 32-year-old man died when a group of armed men attacked commuters on a Metrorail train between Lynedoch and Eerste River on Saturday morning. Eight other male passengers were injured in the incident.

 

 According to Western Cape police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Andrè Traut, the gang robbed commuters of their personal belongings, stabbing them before throwing them from the train.

 Police are investigating a case of murder as well as multiple cases of attempted murder.

 

 This incident has once again put the spotlight on commuter safety on the province's trains after a security guard was robbed and killed in January and a train driver shot dead less than a month later. Earlier this year, train drivers' union Untu threatened to go on strike if the commuter rail agency could not guarantee the safety of their members.
