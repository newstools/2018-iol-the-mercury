Durban - While police are still investigating the skeletal remains found in the Cato Crest area near Cato Manor two weeks ago, another skeleton has been discovered in the Mangroves near Suncoast Casino on Wednesday.

It is alleged that a vagrant who was looking for food in the dense bush of the Mangroves found a skull partially buried in the dunes.

 




KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane said Durban search and rescue, K9 search and rescue and Metro police search and rescue were called on scene to investigate..  
“Police found skeletal remains of a spinal column and a pelvis buried in the dunes,” said Zwane.   The skeletal remains were recovered and removed from the dense Mangroves and an inquest docket was opened at Durban Central police station for investigation.

Meanwhile it was reported that two weeks ago locals who were erecting informal dwellings in the Cato Crest area made the discovery of human remains.
Police spokesperson, Nqobile Gwala said the remains were believed to be female.
An ongoing investigation is being carried out by the Cato Manor police. 
Last year November, Durban search and rescue and ER24 Medical rescue were called out to a house in Amanzimtoti after skeletal remains were found by a gardener.

According to South Coast Sun the gardener was clearing bush at the back of the property when he made the discovery.
The report indicated that ER24 paramedic, Leo Fourie confirmed the skeleton was human but it was unknown whether the skeleton was of a man or woman.
