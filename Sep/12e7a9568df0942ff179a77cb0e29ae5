WORLD - Facebook-owned Instagram has built a “Parent’s Guide” focusing on privacy, interactions and time management for parents who have teenage children using the platform.
“We’ve included the basics of our app and description of our tools, plus a discussion guide for how parents and guardians can have an open conversation with their teens about Instagram,” Marne Levine, chief operating officer, Instagram, wrote in a blog post.
The 10 listed discussion questions have been designed to help parents learn more about how teenagers are using Instagram and to ensure that the app is being used in a positive way like discussing whether they want to keep their accounts public or private. 
The photo-messaging app has also developed a video guide that “gathered a group of parents who work at Instagram to talk about the tools they use to foster positive online experiences for their teens”. “We are committed to being here every step of the way,” Levine said.
