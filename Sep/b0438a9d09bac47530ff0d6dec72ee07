Durban - A Redhill family had to undergo trauma counselling after they were bundled into a bedroom while a gang of armed men ransacked their home on Sunday. The gang fled the home, taking with them the homeowner’s car and household goods.

Marshall Security spokesperson, Kyle van Reenen, said the gang gained entry to the home by climbing over the property’s boundary wall.
“The men armed with firearms, confronted the homeowners, confining them to a bedroom before ransacking the home, and making off with the homeowner’s car and fleeing in an unknown direction. The vehicle, a white Volkswagen Golf VII, was fitted with a tracking device and a signal was found in the Inanda area where it was later recovered abandoned,” van Reenen said.
He added that the homeowners were not physically injured in the ordeal.
The Durban North Victim Support team also attended the scene and counselled the family, who were traumatised.

Police will be investigating further.
