Durban - Miguel Louw's 13-year-old sister, Mikayla had to be sedated after police arrived at the family home on Wednesday night to tell them that the body found in a shallow grave in Phoenix last week was his.

A relative of the family told the Daily News on Thursday that Miguel's father, Kirk Louw, had gone to the Phoenix Mortuary on Wednesday morning for the DNA results but he was told that it was not available. 
In the afternoon, police officials went to the family home on Dr RD Naidu Drive and informed them that the results proved the body was that of Miguel.

The family were still in shock and did not want to speak to the media on Thursday. 

Family spokesperson Vasthie Williams said the family did not know how to deal with the situation and were devastated.
Miguel went missing on July 17 when he was last seen walking home from his school, Rippon Primary School on Clare Road.
Mohammed Ebrahim, 43, who was charged with his kidnapping is still in the awaiting trial section of Westville Correctional Services. He was granted bail in the Durban Magistrates Court but was unable to pay R2500.
He will now be charged with murder, police said.

CCTV footage taken at a local KFC outlet next door to the family home showed Ebrahim with Miguel on the day he went missing. 
He is expected back in court on Monday. The Rippon Primary School will hold a prayer session later on Thursday.
