Durban - Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs MEC Nomusa Dube-Ncube has placed uThukela District Municipality under administration.
Announcing her decision during a council meeting on Wednesday Dube-Ncube said while she was happy with the political and administrative stability in the municipality, she was concerned with its financial position.
Ayanda Makhanya, a local government expert, has been appointed as the municipality’s administrator. 
Dube-Ncube has adopted a no-nonsense approach to problematic councils. 
This is the second municipality she has placed under administration in the past few months. She recently installed an administrator at the Mooi Mpofana municipality. 

Her decision comes a few days after the provincial cabinet gave her the authority to act on uThukela, which has been plagued by labour disputes and allegations of a precarious financial position. 
“The level of performance in the financial area is below our expectations, and we are concerned about the impact of this on service delivery. It is these pressing challenges that have necessitated this intervention,” she said.
Mike Suddaby of the DA said the party welcomed Dube-Ncube’s action, noting: “This was the only way out for the municipality.”
