Durban - A mid-month Central Energy Fund (CEF) report predict's a record high fuel price increase at the end of September as a result of a spike in international oil prices and a huge swing in the Rand/US dollar exchange rate

This time round - based on current data - diesel users will be hit hardest, with a possible price hike of R1.38 per litre, pushing diesel to within a whisker of R16 per litre, while petrol users will be paying R1.12 more per litre, with illuminating paraffin costing R1.17 more.

 




A statement released by the AA claimed that should this increase materialise, it will push the price of 93 unleaded octane fuel inland close to R17 a litre, off a January price of R14.20 – a total increase of around 20 percent, year-to-date.
AA said a massive hike in the diesel price will be especially catastrophic for the agricultural sector which is already reeling from the prolonged drought.

“Extreme fuel price hikes could push marginal businesses, including farms, to financial breaking point, and have a massive negative impact of consumer pricing.”
If this situation doe not improve it will be the biggest fuel price hike in South Africa's history
