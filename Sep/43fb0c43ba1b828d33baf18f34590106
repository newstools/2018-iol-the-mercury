Acting Durban Port Manager, Nokuzola Nkowane, said the port festivals encourage communities to enjoy all the edu-tainment lined up for them, but have the important underlying focus of helping TNPA to raise awareness of the ports, including the career and business opportunities they represent. We want our communities to get excited about the Oceans Economy and to take ownership of the bustling Port of Durban.

Gates open at 10am each day and the hubs of activity within the port will be at the N-Shed (Durban cruise terminal) via Port Entrance 3, Quayside Road (off Margaret Mncadi / Victoria Embankment), as well as at Port Festival Island which is in the vicinity of the Royal Natal Yacht Club / BAT Centre/ Port Natal Maritime Museum.
Blankets, picnic mats and folding chairs are welcome, however, gazebos and picnic umbrellas will not be permitted. Opt for sun hats, caps and sunscreen instead.
