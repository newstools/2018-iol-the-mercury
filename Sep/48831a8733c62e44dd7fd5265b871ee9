Durban - eThekwini Municipality will pump more money into a R91million contract for the construction of medium- and low-voltage electrical networks in the city. 
The executive committee (Exco) yesterday approved the increase in the value of the contract by R30m because of electrification requests from the city.
The requests are from areas whose electrification has not been budgeted for, and the city council says ensuring the areas are electrified will reduce the potential of illegal connections which causes the city council to lose revenue.
The contract was approved in April2016 and was to expire at the end of last month. 
By last month, when the request for the extension of the contract was made, about R83m of the R91m budget was spent.

A document presented at Exco yesterday warned that a failure to provide electricity to affected communities might result in illegal connections which lead to deaths by electrocution.
Nicole Graham, leader of the DA caucus, said while her party supported the extension, especially because it related to essential services, the party felt that there should be better planning, and that extensions should not be approved to cover-up bad planning.
ANC councillor Mondli Mthembu said the massive electrification of informal settlements, recently approved by the city council would be done through the contract in question.
He said when the contract was initially awarded, there was no mass electrification programme.

Mayor Zandile Gumede said city councillors must play oversight on such contracts. 
“We must have a programme to see what is happening in our wards 
“If you don’t supervise you can end up approving these budgets only to find that things are not happening in a manner that they were supposed to,” Gumede said. 
She said officials and councillors needed to work as a collective to ensure that some of the projects were fast-tracked.
