Cape Town - Former Cosatu Western Cape leader Tony Ehrenreich's open letter to President Cyril Ramaphosa in which he said the term "coloured" as derogatory and called for it to be replaced with Camisa has evoked mixed reactions on social media.
 

 Some people objected to Ehrenreich's statements saying that they don't want to be classified as black or white because they are of mixed race.

 

  
 


  
 
 
  
 
 

 
  


 

 
  


 
  
 
 
  
 
 


Tony Ehrenreich assumes himself to be speaking for all of SA's coloured people. The man has delusions of grandeur.

  Others, like the ANC's Western Cape provincial secretary Faiez Jacobs, were supportive of Ehrenreich's letter.
