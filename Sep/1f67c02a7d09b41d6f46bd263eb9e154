Durban - National police minister, Bheki Cele, today visited the University of Zululand's main campus after the institution made headlines for the wrong reasons this past weekend. 
 

 Cele's visit comes just a day after a 20-year-old was stabbed to death after an argument with a room mate. Following the murder, a group of angry students then attacked the alleged killer, pelting him with rocks and kicking him. In videos that have subsequently circulated on social media, graphic scenes are played out with campus security shielding the wounded and bleeding alleged killer. A case of murder has been opened by police.

 

 The attacks have caused an outcry on social media with both past and present students calling for stricter security on campus. 

 

 In a separate incident, 22-year-old Nkanyiso Dhlomo was stabbed to death at the
  University of KwaZulu-Natal’s Westville campus, on Saturday.

In connection with that incident, Sibongiseni Dladla, 20, appeared in the Pinetown Magistrate’s Court yesterday, charged with the murder of fellow student Nkanyiso Dhlomo, 22.
