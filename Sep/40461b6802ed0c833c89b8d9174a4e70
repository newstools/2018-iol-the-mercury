Durban - The incompetence of the S-Bux system for food allowances, late registration and accommodation for National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS)-funded students were some of the issues raised in the memorandum handed over to the Durban University of Technology (DUT), the university management said yesterday. 
The memorandum was handed over to DUT vice-chancellor and principal Professor Thandwa Mthembu by protesting students on Monday morning. 
University spokesperson Alan Khan said the student representative council (SRC) had failed to pitch up for meetings with management yesterday. 
“It is important to mention that the SRC has to date snubbed four meetings within two days that had been agreed upon with management,” Khan said. 
Calls to at least three members of the SRC went unanswered yesterday. 

After Monday’s protest, during which students on the Steve Biko and ML Sultan campuses threatened to abandon their lectures, DUT has beefed up security. 
The university remains fully operational and classes are continuing as usual. 
Questions sent to NSFAS spokesperson Phatisa Ntlonze on Monday were not responded to by yesterday.
