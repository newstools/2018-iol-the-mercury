Durban - DNA results are still outstanding in the murder case of Shallcross schoolgirl Sadia Sukhraj.

He is also charged with the murder of an accomplice and theft of the vehicle Sadia was in. 
They allegedly took Sadia who was sitting in her father’s car in the driveway of her grandparents home. They were spotted by her father Pastor Shalendra Sukhraj, who had been inside dropping off his infant son. AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
Mkhize and his accomplice reportedly drove down a dead end street and were confronted by an off duty police officer. It is not clear when the exchange of gunfire had occurred and while the ballistics test of the bullet or bullets which killed Sadia was complete, this had not been made public. 

The accomplice was killed, Mkhize arrested and a reported third suspect fled. 
While police had initially announced that the arrest of the third suspect was eminent, it was later discovered that this suspected was fabricated. 
The murder has sparked a protest with community members protesting outside the Chatsworth police station demanding more be done to deal with the escalating crime in the area. This has sparked a visit from police Minister Bheki Cele. 
Mkhize was shackled as he was escorted in and out of court. He is due to appear again on November 8.
