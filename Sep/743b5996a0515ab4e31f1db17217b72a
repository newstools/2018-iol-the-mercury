Durban - Incorrect municipal billing and excessive delays in the issuing of rates clearance certificates are hampering businesses in the capital city.
The Pietermaritzburg Chamber of Business (PCB) said the main challenges in operating in the city were the billing system, inaccurate billing, non-receipt of accounts and unfair disconnections by the Msunduzi Municipality. 
PCB chief executive Melanie Veness said another problem was the excessive delays in the issuing of rates clearance certificates which had a severe impact especially on the property industry.
“Properties sold cannot be transferred even when the purchase price has been paid, which means that the seller cannot access the funds and the buyer cannot access the property and cannot develop it.”
Municipal spokesperson Thobeka Mafumbatha said the city attended to issues on a case-by-case basis. 

“We cannot have a blanket approach. If people are affected, they need to get in touch either by going to our offices or emailing, so (they) can be addressed as individual cases.”AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
