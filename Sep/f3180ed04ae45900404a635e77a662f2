Durban - Feuding taxi associations in Ladysmith are in danger of having their operations suspended again after the death of a taxi operator last weekend.

The deputy chairperson of the Klipriver Taxi association, Samson Hlatshwayo, was shot dead on Sunday while driving home. 
A provincial police task team is investigating the case. 
The murder has raised fears that it might reignite the taxi feud between the Sizwe and the Klipriver taxi associations. The two associations have been feuding over routes and their conflict over the past few years has been deadly. 
Hlatshwayo’s son, Funokwakhe Hlatshwayo, said their family was still in the dark about the events leading up to the shooting. 

“He never told us there were new tensions in the industry - we suspect this might be because of the old tensions.” 
Spokesperson for the Department of Transport, Community Safety and Liaison Kwanele Ncalane said MEC Mxolisi Kaunda would meet officials from the associations tomorrow to establish if new tensions had arisen between the two operators.
“MEC Kaunda is exploring all legal avenues available to him to deal with the situation, and if needs be, he will not hesitate to take drastic action,” said Ncalane.
Asked whether this meant Kaunda could order the closing of the rank used by the two associations, Ncalane said, “The MEC is considering all options.” 

The area had been relatively quiet after a shooting last year that left six people, including teachers, dead. Kaunda had then suspended operations by both associations.
