Durban - A 55-year-old man was sentenced to life behind bars after he was convicted for raping his teenage brother-in-law two years ago. 

KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbele, said in July 2016, the accused raped the 15-year-old boy while their family was asleep. 
She said the two were seated in the lounge, watching television. 
"The next day the accused took the teenager for a drive and told him that he regretted the attack the previous day. He then repeatedly raped the boy inside his car and threatened to kill him if he told anyone about the attacks," she said. 
Mbele said the teen reported the rape and a case was opened at the Melmoth police station. 

"The case was taken over by the FamilyViolence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit in Eshowe. The accused was arrested and appeared in court. He was grante dbail until his successful prosecution," Mbele said. 
The man was faced two charges of rape and was duly sentenced. He was also handed down a 15 year sentence for the second charge (of rape).Â 
Mbele said the accused was also declared unfit to possess a firearm. 
The accused then applied for leave to appeal his sentence and to be released on bail and both were not granted.
