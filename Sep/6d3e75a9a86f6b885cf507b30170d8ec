Durban - The Msunduzi Municipality is “going all out” to encourage its residents to pay for municipal services.
From next month there will be an amnesty period for those who have not been paying or have tampered with meters to avoid paying. 
The amnesty period will last three months.
The council also plans to run intense marketing campaigns to educate the public on the value of paying for services, with a “win a car” competition to be won by the council’s "best" ratepayer. 
The efforts are part of a revenue enhancement strategy tabled and approved by exco members recently, and aimed at collecting money to reduce the council’s debt book of R2.2billion. 

Msunduzi mayor Themba Njilo said the amnesty period would give ratepayers the opportunity to update their accounts, but warned that the period would be followed by disconnections and fines.
DA councillor Sibongiseni Majola said that while the party supported the plan, it still had shortcomings. 
“This amnesty encourages people who were not paying. We need to be clear about what is going to happen to those who will not come forward. 
“There needs to be a more aggressive way to pursue those people,” said Majola.
