Durban - Morningside residents who live near Fyfe Road fear for their safety after a spate of gunshots were heard over the past few weeks.

 Resident Hendrico Meyer said he heard gunshots twice in one week, last Sunday evening at 20:51pm and again on Monday night at 9:40pm.
 “I was busy getting ready for bed and all of a sudden two gunshots rang through the neighbourhood. Sounded very close to my house. For a second there I did not move,” said Meyer
 Kensington Road resident, Lynne Botha said hearing gunshots has become a norm in her neighbourhood.
 “I'm based in Kensington which is up the hill from Fyfe Road where the problems are. It's the norm these days. We hear two to three shots every fourth night sometimes,” said Botha.

 Botha said she lived in Fyfe Road for a short period but moved because of the crime.
 “If it's not attempted theft or break-ins, it's cars being stolen. I lived in Fyfe for not even five months and left due to fence hoppers and two attempted break-ins and one actual break-in. Unfortunately it's not safe down there,” she said.
 Ward 25 councillor, Hassan Haniff said it is not known for certain why guns are being fired so often but he believes they come from inside the Fyfe Road informal settlement which is opposite Morningside village.
 “I’ve spoken to residents of the settlement who indicated that a gunshot is fired in the evening for people to go inside. It’s a criminal or political way to instill fear and control the people in the settlement,”said Hassan

 KZN police spokesperson, Captain Nqobile Gwala said she checked with Durban Central SAPS and no incidents were reported.
“We encourage the community to report crimes as it will enable police to respond timely and intercept criminals before they getaway. Communities are urged to be more proactive by reporting suspicious activities as this will act as a deterrent to criminals,” said Gwala.
