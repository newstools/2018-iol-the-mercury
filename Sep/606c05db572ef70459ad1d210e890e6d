Durban - KwaZulu-Natal Health MEC, Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo, has condemned the murder of a 31-year-old nurse whose body was found on a cliff at Oribi Gorge, on the KZN south coast last week.

The nurse, Nelisa Cele, was six months pregnant at the time of her death. She was enrolled at the Gamalakhe Community Healthcare Centre since 2011.
It is believed that Cele had left home on Wednesday to take delivery of her new car and failed to return home.
Two days later, her body was discovered by a visitor to the Gorge who had been birdwatching at the time.
Although the circumstances around Cele’s death remain the subject of a police investigation, it is alleged that her attacker tried to discard of the body by throwing it into the gorge, however, the body became lodged on tree branches.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

Police said Cele’s body showed assault wounds. A case of murder has been opened with Paddock police and no arrests have been made.
Dhlomo said he was shocked and saddened by Cele’s death.  
“The murder of a healthcare worker is always a sad day for us because these are people who are tasked to do the Lord’s work, which is to save lives and bring healing to those who are ailing. These incidents are therefore extremely concerning. There is just no place for brutal incidents such as this one in our society. It is unacceptable, and we call on law enforcement authorities to do everything in their power to bring those responsible to book. We send our deepest condolences to the family at this difficult time, and would also like to urge anyone who might have information regarding this murder to come forward and alert law enforcement authorities,” he said.
Cele’s memorial service will be held at the Methodist Church next to Gamalakhe CHC on Thursday at 1 pm. She will be buried on Saturday.
