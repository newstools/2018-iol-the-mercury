The city has urged residents to be vigilant to avoid falling prey to a new scam that targets pensioners.
City spokesperson Mandla Nsele said pensioners were being scammed via telephonic calls by persons pretending to be officials offering a rebate for water meters.
He said the culprits issued reference numbers to the residents and informed them that they would be contacted by another official in the coming days and a form would need to be completed and signed to qualify for the rebate.
“The municipality confirms that there is no such process nor under any circumstances will customers be asked to make on the spot cash payments.
“Payments are made strictly only via our municipal banking halls, Sizakala centres and/or our third party collectors indicated on the bill. Property owners qualify for the rebate on their primary property when they turn 60. This rebate was renewed annually. Both new application forms and renewal forms are available on the municipal website,” said Nsele.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
