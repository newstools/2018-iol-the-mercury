Durban - Traffic backed up on the N3 highway yesterday after two incidents involving trucks, including a horrific multiple vehicle crash which left three people injured. 
One person had to be airlifted to hospital after the car they were in was struck by a truck. Pinetown firefighters had to use the jaws of life to free the person who was trapped in the wreckage for more than an hour, said Rescue Care spokesperson Garrith Jamieson. 
The crash also left three others injured when the truck collided with the two vehicles and two trucks. 
The crash happened in heavy traffic which was caused by another incident - a truck that was on fire - some metres down the highway in the Durban-bound section. 
It is not clear what caused the truck fire. 

Earlier, eThekwini firefighters were called out to the scene of a taxi fire in Morningside. Nkulumo Dube, division commander at the Durban Central fire station said when they arrived on the scene on Fellows Road, the taxi was well alight. AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
He said the driver, who managed to escape the blaze, was sitting alone in the taxi which operates as scholar transport, when the fire broke out. 
Dube said it was suspected the fire was caused by an electric fault. 
Metro police spokesperson Senior Superintendent Parboo Sewpersadh said the road had to be closed while the fire was being extinguished.
