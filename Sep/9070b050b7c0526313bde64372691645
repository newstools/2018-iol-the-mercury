Durban - Just seconds before the man accused of murdering a Phoenix mother and her two daughters was due to appear in the dock at the Verulam Magistrate's Court, he had to be placed on an IV drip. The accused, who according to police has a pre-existing heart condition, was escorted out of the packed court room where emergency teams could attend to him.
 

 Meanwhile, the family of the deceased women were visibly upset at the delay. 

 

 The man is accused of murdering 
 Jane, 44, Denisha, 22, and Rackelle, 16, inside their two-bedroom Tasvir Mansions flat in Longcroft, on Friday morning.

 

 The triple murders have sent shockwaves through the community.
