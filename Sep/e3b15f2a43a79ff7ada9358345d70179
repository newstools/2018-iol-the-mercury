New Delhi - Delhi's ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Monday joined the nationwide shutdown protest called by the Congress saying they were against the fuel price rise but not supporting the Congress party.

AAP Leaders, MPs and MLAs joined the Bharat Bandh called by the Congress and Left and joined a protest march of opposition parties here on Monday.
"The AAP is of the clear view that all opposition parties must unite and force the Modi government to reverse its anti-people policies which are solely responsible for the price rise, particularly the unprecedented rise in prices of petrol and diesel," AAP spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj said in a statement.
But he added that the Congress cannot be "the umbrella under which all opposition parties are comfortable".
"Congress has to shun its big brother and unreasonable attitude towards other parties. No political party in India is subservient to Congress and it must bear this fact in mind," he said.

 Meanwhile in South Africa local social injustice group People Against Petrol and Paraffin Price Increases (Papppi) have called for the nationalisation of chemicals and energy company Sasol.
PAPPPI believes that South Africans should not pay more than R10 for Sasol fuel and has called for the boycott of all Sasol garages.
Sasol spokesperson Matebello Motloung said: “Nationalisation of privately-held companies is not part of the current government’s policy.”
The price of fuel, added Motloung, was regulated by the government.

Last week Energy Minister Jeff Radebe said there would be 4.9c/litre increase to cater for the annual salary increase for forecourt attendants, cashiers and other staff.
