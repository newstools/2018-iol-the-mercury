DURBAN - President Cyril Ramaphosa and eThekwini Mayor Zandile Gumede launched a safety and security programme in KwaMashu on Saturday which will see 200 new metro police officers deployed around the city. Some of the 200 officers will be deployed in KwaMashu.
The announcement was made during the Durban-leg of the now famous Ramaphosa Walks. 
The programme was at Ramaphosa’s early morning walk in KwaMashu which saw hundreds of people brave the heavy rain and cold weather, to walk in support of a healthier lifestyle. 
But Ramaphosa said they were walking with purpose to better the lives of people in the community. Addressing the crowd at the Bridge City Mall at KwaMashu, he said the event was “a walk with purpose”.
“Today, this is a walk with purpose because it revolves around a place where people can feel safe and secure. We want to make our streets safer so we are launching a programme which will make the area safer,” said Ramaphosa.
