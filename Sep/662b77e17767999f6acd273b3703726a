Durban - Winter does not yet appear to have loosened its grip as most parts of KwaZulu-Natal experienced icy conditions this weekend, and snow fell on the southern Drakensberg.
Giants Castle, Mooi River, Matatiele, Kokstad, Underberg and Impendle had snowfalls on Saturday night and Sunday morning. 
By 2pm on Sunday, Snow Report SA reported that snow had stopped falling and was melting quickly in most places, including Sani Pass. 
The snow in the Midlands region melted completely by the afternoon.
A forecaster at the SA Weather Service, Julius Mahlangu, said the coldest days of the cold front had passed and temperatures were expected to pick up during the week. 

With temperatures below 15ºC on Saturday and reaching about 20ºC on Sunday, Mahlangu said the province could experience an increase of one or two degrees in temperatures in the week. AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
“There is no rainfall expected for most of this week, but there is a 30%chance of rain for Friday,” he said. 
Mahlangu said it was difficult to predict whether this weekend’s cold front marked the end of winter. 
“The cold front has not completely left us, so it’s hard to say whether this is the end of winter. 

“We could have one or two more cold days before we get into summer,” Mahlangu said.
The area around the King Shaka International Airport had the most rainfall (47mm recorded).
Greytown, Mount Edgecombe and La Mercy recorded 43mm of rainfall.
