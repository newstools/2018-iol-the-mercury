Durban - Lectures will take place at the Durban University of Technology today, even though students are calling for a shutdown until their food allowances are paid. 
Protesters barged into classes at the Steve Biko and ML Sultan campuses yesterday morning and forced students to abandon lectures and join them. 
More than 300 students are demanding that their meal allowances - known as S-Bux - be paid to them.
Only some of those funded by the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) have been paid their S-Bux this semester.
One student, who asked not be named, said they had no choice but to protest. “We are hungry and no one cares. How can we concentrate on lectures and tests if our stomachs are grumbling?” the student asked. 

Police spokesperson Lieutenant- Colonel Thulani Zwane said public order police were monitoring the situation, but there had been no arrests.
A poster with the university’s logo was shared on social media at the weekend. It told students the protest was taking place, and that they aimed to “#ShutDownDUT”. The poster also used a hashtag #OneStudentOneStone calling for students to throw stones during the protest. 
DUT spokesperson Alan Khan said the vice-chancellor and principal, Professor Thandwa Mthembu, had received a memorandum with a list of demands from the Students’ Representative Council (SRC) yesterday.
Khan gave the assurance that lectures would resume.

The NSFAS did not respond to a request for comment yesterday.
