Durban - A man accused of stealing road construction material bound for Zambia from Isipingo was caught after a chance encounter with the person he allegedly stole from.
Solomon Munika, 38, who was arrested last Wednesday, was granted bail in the Durban Magistrateâ€™s Court yesterday. 
State prosecutor Calvin Govender told the court that Munika - a transport broker - had been contracted to see to the transportation of drums of bitumen, or asphalt, used to tar roads, to Lusaka International Airport. 
The agreement was for it to be driven between August 2 and 4 in three trucks, and a deposit of more than R80 000 was paid to him. 
When the delivery did not arrive at the promised time, the recipient in Lusaka contacted the supplier, who in turn inquired with Munika. 

Govender said Munika kept giving the supplier excuses and eventually stopped taking his calls. 
The supplier then saw Munika by chance in Montclair, and called the police. 
In his affidavit to apply for bail, Munika disclosed a previous conviction for fraud, for which he served 20 months in prison. 
Munika said he intended pleading not guilty and denied the allegation. 

While he has family in his home country of Zimbabwe, he said he was not a flight risk as he had been in South Africa for 10 years, and was married to a South African working for the Department of Education, with whom he had two minor children, two properties and other assets. 
Magistrate Mohamed Motala said he would give him the benefit of the doubt, and granted bail of R2 000. 
He is due back in court on November 16.
In a separate case in the same court, four people appeared for stealing 103 bags of sugar and 50kg of rice from a warehouse in Maydon Wharf this week. They were arrested while allegedly loading the goods, valued at an estimated R110 000, on to a truck. 

Their case was adjourned to September 3.
