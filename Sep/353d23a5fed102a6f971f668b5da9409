DURBAN - AS THOUSANDS of proud Zulu maidens began descending to the King's eNyokeni Palace for the reed dance on Friday ahead of the big event on Saturday, some girls, who attended festivities on Friday started sharing their pictures on social media.
On Friday, non-schooling maidens presented their reeds to King Goodwill Zwelithini, while thousands more from other parts of KwaZulu-Natal, Gauteng and Mpumalanga made their way to eNyokeni. The king is expected to deliver his annual speech at eNyokeni on Saturday afternoon.
On social media, maidens began sharing their joy at being at the reed dance with the #ReedDance and #UmkhosiWohlanga.
One of them was ‘Kwanda Berry’, who tweeted in isiZulu - ‘we are back again this year’ and ‘it’s that time again’, sharing pictures of herself in traditional gear for maidens.
