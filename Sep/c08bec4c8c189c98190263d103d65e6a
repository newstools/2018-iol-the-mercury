Durban - The three men accused of killing Vereeniging siblings in a Tongaat rock-throwing incident have been denied bail. 
Mechanic Selvan Govender, 46, his son Nathan Govender, 27, and employee Qiniso Bhekithemba Gumbi, 20, were denied bail in the Verulam Magistrateâ€™s Court yesterday.
The three are charged with the murder of Amina Haffajee, 16, and her young brother, Abdul Rahim, 7. 
Amina and Abdul were crushed when a rock was thrown off a bridge above the N2 on to the vehicle they were in last December. 
Magistrate Vera Alamchand ruled that the men were flight risks as the home they all lived in had been severely vandalised after their arrests and they could not return to it.

She also said the court had taken into account the vulnerability of the witnesses, who had been fearful to report what they had seen.
Alamchand said the case had also caused a public outcry as it was one of an increasing number of rock- throwing incidents in the province, and the most serious. 
The case was initially investigated by the Tongaat police, but two months later it was transferred to Detective Ivan Padayachee of the Organised Crimes Unit, who testified during the bail hearing that there were five witnesses who had fingered the Govenders and Gumbi. 
The court heard that the witnesses, who were all minors at the time, were known to the accused. 

Defence attorney Rajendra Nathalal had argued during the bail hearing that the men would plead not guilty and they had no knowledge of the State witnesses. The case was postponed to November 9.
