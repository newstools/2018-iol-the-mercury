Durban - KwaZulu-Natal Transport MEC, Mxolisi Kaunda, has called an urgent meeting with the community of uMlazi and the board at the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) following last week’s vandalism of a train station. 

Preliminary investigations reveal that commuters went on a rampage after experiencing train delays.  On Thursday, a female train driver was attacked in Stanger by commuters and she is currently fighting for her life in hospital. 
Kaunda has condemned the incidents and vowed that police will work around the clock to ensure that all those responsible for the damage of government property and the attack of a train driver will be brought to book.

He said that government viewed both the uMlaza and Stanger incidents as pure acts of criminality and the law enforcement agencies must ensure that the culprits who committed crime face the full might of the law.

“No amount of anger can warrant damage to property whether public or private. As government, we have taken a decision that people who embark on illegal public protests and damage property must be charged criminally and be litigated individually,” said Kaunda. 
Kaunda hopes that the meeting will bring stability to the area so the train operations can resume.
