Durban - The Association of Sport Performance Centres (ASPC) in partnership with the KwaZulu-Natal Department of Sport and Recreation is hosting the first ASPC African Sport Forum in Durban.
The event set to run at the Moses Mabhida Stadium from Thursday to Friday is also supported by the SA Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee (Sascoc), eThekwini Municipality and the Durban Chamber of Commerce and Industry. It’s the first time an ASPC continental forum will be hosted on the African continent and is a direct result of discussions initiated at the 10th International Forum on Elite Sport held in Durban, which generated more than R20million in revenue for the city’s economy last year. 
The conference is expected to give the province a significant economic boost as it will draw athletes, officials and other stakeholders from across the continent and the world, while enhancing Durban’s credibility as Africa’s Sports and Events Capital.
“We are excited to be part of the ASPC Continental Forum which brings together sports leaders, administrators, coaches and athletes from throughout Africa to discuss best practices and a wide range of sports-related topics,” MEC for for Arts, Culture, Sport and Recreation, Bongi Sithole-Moloi, said.
“This forum will leave a lasting legacy for our province as lessons learnt will inform our plans to develop podium athletes, utilising African developed solutions.”AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
