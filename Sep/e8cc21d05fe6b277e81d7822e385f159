Durban - While Miguel Louw’s family are still waiting for DNA results to confirm whether his body was found in Phoenix on Monday, religious leaders and residents yesterday held a prayer at the site where a child’s body was found.
Present were the two officers from the Durban Central K9 unit, Sergeant Collin Chetty, Warrant Officer Cheryl Ellis and 3-year-old German Shepherd police dog Ghost, who found the body in a shallow grave in bushes along Longbury Drive.
Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said DNA had been taken from 10-year-old Miguel’s relatives for the DNA tests.
Miguel’s family, from Sydenham, have been pleading for his safe return since he was last seen with Mohammed Ebrahim near his school. 
Ebrahim, 43, who was charged with kidnapping, was granted bail in the Durban Magistrate’s Court last week, but is still in custody as he has not been able to post the R2500 bail. The grave where the body was found this week is less than a kilometre from where Ebrahim lived with his family.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

eThekwini Municipality deputy mayor Fawzia Peer asked the community to keep Miguel’s family in their thoughts. “Let us keep them in our soulful prayer, and hope that there is swift justice to bring closure as a way of healing for the grieving family,” she said. 
Aroona Chetty, the director of Phoenix Child and Family Welfare, said child protection should be everybody’s responsibility.
“We’ve had three child murders in three years in Phoenix; this is unacceptable. We as a community need to stand together and wipe out child abuse,” she said. 
Chetty was speaking at the gathering organised by the Phoenix Religious Leaders Forum.

The forum’s chairperson, Moulana Mohamed Tariq, said it was aimed at bringing comfort to the community, who were very angry.
Miguel’s family declined to comment this week.
