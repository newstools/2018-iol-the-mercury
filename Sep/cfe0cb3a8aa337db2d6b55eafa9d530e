Durban - Durban City Hall was placed on high alert yesterday as authorities feared a group of disgruntled Metro Police officers and city security guards might storm the building.
Metro Police officers maintained a presence in and outside the hall where the city’s executive committee met. 
Later, the main entrances were locked due to the perceived security threat. Officials said it was security protocol to lock the doors whenever a group came unannounced.
The Mercury understands that the group was demanding, among other things, the reinstatement of three colleagues expelled last week.
It is alleged they had made disparaging remarks to a superior, who they claim had used the k-word in reference to them.

The disgruntled officers also want ed senior managers removed who they believed were irregularly appointed. 
Those targeted include Metro Police acting head Wiseman Mchunu.
They accused Mchunu of victimising those who had worked closely with the former head, Eugene Nzama.
Mchunu denied this, saying “there is a collective agreement which governs the rules of engagement and as the employer we always follow the rules of that agreement”.

Asked whether the department would act against the officers, Mchunu said the department would first get all the facts “and take it from there”. 
The officers met management yesterday.
