Durban - Murder suspect's father Thulani Zungu slammed police for the unlawful arrest of his son Gift and his nephew, Msunduzi councillor Nkosinathi "TK" Gambu, who are facing charges of murdering a comrade. 

Both men and another four suspects appeared before magistrate Ashin Singh in the Pietermaritzburg Magistrate’s Court on Thursday for what was supposed to be their bail hearing.
The six men are accused of murdering ANC activist Musawenkosi “Maqatha” Mchunu in May.
Mchunu, a former Msunduzi councillor, was killed after he raised issues relating to corruption in the municipality. Outside court, along Church Street, two ANC factions hurled insults at one another. A bigger crowd demanding justice on behalf of Mchunu carried placards with a message to deny bail to the accused.
Zungu said his son could not be linked to conspiracy of the killing of Mchunu because they were very close. 

“I strongly believe that the killer is still at large. Police were under pressure to arrest the suspects. The killing should be investigated among their faction after there were rumours of misdirecting funds on their side,” Zungu said.
He added the truth would prevail when the real killers were caught.
Police spokesperson Liuetenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said he could not comment because the matter was being handled at a national level.
Inside court, the bail application of Gambu, Gift Zungu, Sikhanyiso Zimu, Sifiso Mbelu, Mlungisi Zimu and Ayanda Ngubane was delayed for two weeks because their lawyers said they were not ready.

All were charged with conspiracy to commit murder and premeditated murder.
Defence lawyer Mohammed Beni argued that the defence did not have full access to the docket. He urged the court to prove the conspiracy theory charge.
