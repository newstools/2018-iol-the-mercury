Durban - A woman survived a horrific attack after she was hacked with a sugarcane knife during an attack on a Darnall farm on the North Coast yesterday morning. 
Police said the woman, believed to be in her thirties, was hacked on the head and body by the attacker, who had entered her home at about 6am.
“She sustained head and body injuries and was taken to hospital. A case of attempted murder has been opened at KwaDukuza SAPS. The police are still searching for the suspect who fled,” said police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala.
A source close to the investigation said the man had entered the house alone.
“The woman was with her child doing something in the kitchen, and when she heard the door opening, she thought it was one of the employees. Her husband, who is a farm manager, was not in the house at the time,” said the source.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

The man had attacked the woman apparently without saying a word and had not taken or asked for anything from the house.
“He was one of the workers at the farm. He had been there for many years; we do not know what triggered this,” said the source.
The injured woman managed to contact neighbours, who in turn notified farm watch.
She was taken to hospital by ambulance.

Sources told The Mercury that the man had also hacked the family dog. 
“The dog was not severely injured. The lady, on the other hand, was injured badly but she is stable in hospital,” said one.
The search for the assailant was well under way by yesterday afternoon. “We believe the suspect will be found because he is known. We think he disappeared into the reserves, hence it has been difficult to track him down.”
Earlier in the day, a helicopter was also involved in the search.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
