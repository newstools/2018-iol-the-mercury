Durban - The Ugu Municipality on the KwaZulu-Natal South Coast says it is working hard to ensure that Harding does not reach Day Zero as reservoir levels plummet to below 10%.
Harding and surrounding areas have faced severe water shortages because of the prolonged drought.
France Zama, spokesperson for the municipality, said water shedding had been implemented. 
Restrictions include forbidding the use of fire hydrants and fire hoses for any purposes other than firefighting; the filling of swimming pools; the use of sprinkler or irrigation systems; and only buckets may be used to wash cars.
Taps and showers left to run, and leaking cisterns and taps would be regarded as an offence.

“Strict penalties (fines up to R4000) will be levied against any identified transgressions,” Zama said.
Tankers from Port Shepstone are supplying water on a 24-hour basis. 
“The cost of supplying water coupled with limited resources have placed a strain on municipal operations, considering the distance travelled by tankers,” said Zama.
The municipality has embarked on a drought-awareness campaign, which includes teaching water-saving methods to residents, and will be engaging all key stakeholders.
