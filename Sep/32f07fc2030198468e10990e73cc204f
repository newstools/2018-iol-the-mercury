Durban - The body of a young boy dressed in a full school uniform has been found at a site near Phoenix, north of Durban.

Police forensics have descended on an area in Longbury Drive. 
While details are sketchy there are growing fears that the body could be that of missing nine-year-old Durban schoolboy Miguel Louw.

"We are at the scene at Longbury Drive, Phoenix, where a decomposed body suspected to be the one of the missing boy was found in the bushes. The boy went missing on 17 July in the Sydenham area. The scene is still (active)," Gwala said.

Miguel Louw went missing on July 17 shortly after leaving his school on Rippon Road.
He was last seen on the day in the presence of Mohammed Ebrahim who was last week granted R2500 bail in the Durban Magistrate's Court in connection with his abduction.
Detectives tied Ebrahim to Miguel after CCTV footage taken from a KFC in Sydenham showed them together buying a meal.
Ebrahim was found in possession of Miguel's birth certificate and his mother’s identity document.

Strict bail conditions were imposed on Ebrahim including that he reports three times a week to the Sydenham police station. He was also not allowed in Sydenham.
Ebrahim is expected back in court on October 17.
