DURBAN - BURN wounds on Zinhle Mchunu’s leg have healed, but she’s still hurting inside.

Mchunu, a domestic worker, was not at the Durban Magistrate’s Court last week to face her alleged attacker, and employer’s son, Dustin Govender.
Govender, 28, is adamant he was “just playing around” when he dropped a flammable liquid on Mchunu’s feet and set her on fire.
Govender, who is facing an attempted murder charge, has been released on R7 000 bail. In May, Govender allegedly poured petrol at Mchunu’s feet, and threw his lighter in the pool of liquid.
Before setting the woman alight, he allegedly told her: “I’m just playing around.” Mchunu was later admitted to hospital and has since returned to her Ndwedwe home.

“I’m worried I will never be able to work again. My mother is working now as a domestic worker to support us,” she said.
“I’m struggling. I can’t do things on my own, and my family is struggling financially,” she added.
Previously, outside court Govender’s father Don, said his son had not intentionally poured petrol on Mchunu’s feet.
“He is hurting inside, but I’ve told him to stay strong as this shall pass. It is not for me to take sides. God is the judge,” he said.

About Mchunu, he added: “I wish her a speedy recovery... accidents do happen at work.”
