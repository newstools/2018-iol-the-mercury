Durban - Durban’s Integrity and Investigations Unit is looking into how an impostor could have used eThekwini city manager Sipho Nzuza’s municipal email address to solicit a bribe from a construction company bidding for a tender.
The municipality confirmed the probe after it was brought to their attention after the company’s director raised his concern with the DA’s eThekwini whip, Marlaine Nair.
According to Nair, the email sender, posing as Nzuza, made reference to a contract number for a job in KwaDabeka (ward 20). 
The sender requested the director of the company to urgently contact “Nzuza” on a cellphone number provided. 
The email address belongs to “Nzuza” and has the “durban.gov.za” domain. 

The director, who did not want to be named, contacted the person posing as Nzuza and was told that R100000 should be deposited into a bank account, the details of which were provided by the impostor. AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
According to Nair, the director contacted his attorney, who ­investigated the bank account and advised him that the matter was fraudulent.
“We are shocked that a fraudulent email communication came from a durban.gov.za domain name, which implies that the perpetrator is from within the municipality, soliciting bribes while under the city (council’s) payroll,” Nair said.
The Mercury was unable to contact Nzuza for comment at the time of publishing.
