Durban - As this years crime statistics show, police enjoyed marginal success in detecting criminal conduct including recovering illegal firearms, security experts have warned that a more concerted effort is required to rid the country of illegal guns. 
The KwaZulu-Natal statistics showed that in cases of illegal possession of firearms and ammunition, the cases of recoveries had increased from 4000 to 4418, representing 418 new cases.
“It is encouraging that the police are getting to more illegal guns, but this is still the tip of the iceberg there are many more out there. Our country will be much safer if more effort is put in dealing with the illegal guns,” said Mary de Haas of KwaZulu-Natal Violence Monitor. 

 


Statistics also showed that the number of those arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs had increased by 4815 from 13403 to 18218.

In dealing with sexual offences detected as result of police action, the police experienced setbacks recording 38 cases less than last year, with the figures moving from 3558 down to 3520.
