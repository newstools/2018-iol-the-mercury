Van Reenen said as the helicopter arrived, the patient went into cardiac arrest. "Paramedics worked fervently to stabalise the man and after about 30 minutes a pulse was returned. Due to the man being unstable for flight, he was taken rapidly to Mahatma Gandhi Hospital."
The patient died at the hospital.
The road was closed for emergency services personnel and the helicopter landing, but has since been reopened.
