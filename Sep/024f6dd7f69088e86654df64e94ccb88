Durban - The Private Security Industry Regulatory Authority (PSiRA) has suspended the registration of Mvimbeni Security pending the outcome of an internal investigation.

The company was allegedly involved in the April 27 shooting at the Brook Street taxi rank which left three people dead.
Manabela Chauke, PSiRA chief executive, said the suspension was pending the outcome of the code of conduct case scheduled to commence from 25 September 2018 in Durban.
“Following the suspension notice, the SAPS seized firearms licensed to the same security service provider, while eight of its staff members are still in custody since the shooting. The act of lawlessness and criminality by any private security service provider will not be allowed in the industry,” Chauke said.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
He said security officers were bound by a code of conduct which among others provided that private security companies might not infringe any rights of a person as provided for in the Bill of Rights.

The shooting started when armed men in a Toyota Quantum minibus taxi opened fire at the taxi rank.
At the time, the Independent on Saturday reported that the shooting was followed by a high-speed car chase on the freeway, which ended in a hail of bullets between the police and the gunmen in Pinetown.
Approached for comment, the security company declined to comment.
Provincial police were yet to confirm when pressed for comment.
