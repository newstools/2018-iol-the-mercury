Durban - Deputy President David Mabuza said yesterday that while the country was renowned for its diversity, all South Africans needed to unite for it to prosper. Mabuza was in Kokstad in KwaZulu-Natal for Heritage Day where he also unveiled a statue of the East Griqualand leader Adam Kok III.
 

 
  
 
 
“As it is written in our Seal of State and Coat of Arms, written in the Khoisan language of the IXam people, we have to tell you: diverse people unite!

 “For we are meeting at a time in our history when the divisions of our past, when our heightened sense of retreat to the past threatens national unity. Even though there is no need for divisions, if we hold our hands together in addressing the imbalances of the past we are guaranteeing future generations a prosperous South Africa worthy of inheritance,” Mabuza said.

“It is understandable that human beings are prone, in times of national strife, in times of bitter socio-economic hardship, in times of hard debates about land reform to retreat easily into narrow nationalist, racial and ethnic enclaves. However, I stand in front of you on this day to state with conviction that this path we have chosen is the correct one. It is the path that will unite our nation and one that will help us to forge a common nationhood.”

  
 


Addressing the Griqualand leaders and Kok III’s relatives, Mabuza said the unveiling of the statue and renaming of Greater Kokstad Municipality’s main building after Kok III was a symbol of recognising the Khoisan as part of South African society. 

However, leaders of the East Griqualand community told Mabuza that the Khoisan would only have their dignity and respect restored once the government gives them land so they can install their own “kings and queens” to rule over them like other indigenous nations in the country.
