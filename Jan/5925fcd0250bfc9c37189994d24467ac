Pitol Zamani Gumede, 26, of Hluhluwe in northern KwaZulu-Natal, is expected to appear at the Ubombo Magistrates Court on on Wednesday facing two counts of murder and one of arson. 

Police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said Gumede had approached Mzamo Mbuyazi, 20 and his girlfriend Sibongile Ntshangase, 32, at their house at Mduku area in Hluhluwe the night after Christmas last year. 

He allegedly stabbed them with a spear and set their house on fire with them inside. 

"Through hard work by local detectives, the suspect was traced and arrested. The members further recovered a knife and a spear suspected to be used during the commission of an offence," said Mbhele. 

It was then discovered that he had previously been convicted of rape and was out on parole. 

 Acting provincial police commissioner Major General Bheki Langa commended the Hluhluwe police for apprehending the suspect and brought him before court. “I condemned the violent act showed by the suspect. This is totally unacceptable and our police officers will thoroughly investigate the matter and make sure that the suspect is convicted of his alleged action,” he said.
