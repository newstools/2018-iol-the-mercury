KwaZulu-Natal cleaned up at the annual SAPS National Excellence Awards.Described by National Police Commissioner General Khehla Sitole as an opportunity to honour the country’s policemen and women “for the excellent service they render to their communities, and the SAPS as an organisation”, the awards were held at Durban’s Inkosi Albert Luthuli International Convention Centre on Friday.And KZN scooped several coveted titles, including “Best Station of the Year”, which went to the Port Shepstone police station.Police management said that over the course of the last year, the South Coast station had managed to get murders, contact crimes, property crimes and trio crimes in the precinct down.“Owing to limited resources, routine duties were arranged on a flexi-hour basis to address the needs and safety of the community. “Operations were scheduled during the early mornings, late nights and on the weekends. Members are readily available to work extra time with no remuneration,” management said.“Regular cordon-and-search operations – as well as roadblocks – were conducted throughout the station’s policing area, at identified hotspots. These operations yielded good results in arrests for crimes such as possession of drugs, prostitution, illegal dealing in liquor, road traffic offences and drunken driving.”The Community Policing Forum (CPF) of the Year award went to the Chatsworth CPF.Police management said neighbourhood watches and street committees were established in the precinct, and that regular street patrols had led to a decrease in criminal activities.“Identified drug dealers, their networks and other information received from locals was filtered through to the SAPS, thus enabling them to make regular arrests,” management said. “Problematic members of the youth were identified and a concerted effort was made to rehabilitate them.”Umlazi K9 Unit’s Sergeant Sabelo Xaba scooped a Visible Policing Employee of the Year award for his work with the Organised Crime Unit, Commercial Crime Unit, National Security Intelligence, Cluster Task Team and Provincial Drugs Task Team.Pinetown home cleaned up in robbery“He also achieved a number of successes through his own initiative and by conducting observation duties,” police management said. “Sergeant Xaba often performed duties seven days a week.
