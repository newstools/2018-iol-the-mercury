Traffic was backed on the N2 highway on Tuesday morning after a vehicle overturned just before the Umgeni Interchange.

Rescue Care's Garrith Jamieson said two people were injured in the crash, one suffering critical injuries.

He said it appeared that the driver of the vehicle had lost control and the bakkie overturned several times coming to rest on its roof on the N2 north before Umgeni interchange.

 
"Just after 10am, Rescue Care paramedics arrived on the scene to find the vehicle on its roof in the fast lane. Two occupants of the vehicle had been ejected whilst the vehicle was rolling. 

The passenger had sustained critical injuries and was placed on a manual ventilator on the scene before being transported to hospital for the further care that they required. Traffic was severely affected and built up to Spaghetti Junction."
 
He said Metro Police had attended the scene and the cause of the crash was under investigation by the authorities.

Earlier on Tuesday morning, a mother and her two children sustained moderate injuries after being knocked over by a car on Main Road, Malvern just after 6am.

 
Jamieson said in that crash, Rescue Care paramedics arrived on the scene to find the mother and her two children aged two and eight lying in the roadway. 

"They were stabilised on the scene before being transported to a nearby hospital. The driver of the vehicle had also sustained minor injuries and was treated on scene before being transported to a nearby hospital."
