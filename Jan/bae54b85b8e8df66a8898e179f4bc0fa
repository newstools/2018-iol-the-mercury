Police are appealing to the public for any information on a toddler who went missing on New Year’s Eve on the KwaZulu-Natal south Coast.
They said in a statement on Tuesday that three-year-old Sphesihle Zama Dlamini attended a church service in Amandawe on December 31, 2017. 
“She was playing with other children, however, when her mother looked for her at about 9am, the little girl was missing. An extensive search by police and community members proved fruitless.”
The child, they said in a statement, had been wearing a pink dress with white stripes and white shoes. 
“She was allegedly last seen in the vicinity of a tavern in Slangeni Ward, Amandawe.”
