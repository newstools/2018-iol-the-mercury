Durban - Omesh Ramnarain says he was neither under the influence of alcohol nor speeding, when he crashed into two cyclists, on Durban’s M4, in February 2016.

Ramnarain on Monday pleaded not guilty to charges of culpable homicide, in connection with the crash, in which cyclists - Richard da Silva, 46, and Jared Dwyer, 36 - dead.

As his trial got underway, in the Durban Regional Court, Ramnarain’s advocate, Murray Pitman, read into record his client’s plea statement.

In the statement, Ramnarain said he was on his way home from Rocca Bar nightclub, at the time.

“During my visit to Rocca Bar, I consumed in total four Hunters Gold drinks,” he said, “While sitting at the bar, one of the other patrons in the bar spilt their drink on me”.

He also maintained he was traveling within the speed limit of 100 km per hour, at the time of the incident. 

Ramnarain's statement is contrary to statements from witnesses,who are expected to be called to testify by the State, who allege he was speeding and under the influence of alcohol when the crash occurred.

The trial continues.
