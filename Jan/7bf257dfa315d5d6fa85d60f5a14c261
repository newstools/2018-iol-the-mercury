Police have confirmed the arrest of three suspects and the recovery of three unlicensed firearms in North Coast Road on Wednesday morning.
They said in a statement shortly after the incident that Durban Flying Squad members and a security company had made the arrest and were conducting their patrols around the area when they were informed that a white Toyota Fortuner suspected to be involved in house robbery cases in the area had been spotted. 
“They gave chase and the suspects alighted from the vehicle and allegedly fired shots towards the members. The members retaliated and one suspect was shot and wounded. He was taken to hospital for treatment and the other two suspects were arrested.”
