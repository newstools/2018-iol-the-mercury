It has since emerged that the baby's kidnapping had been faked by the child's mother along with a man purported to be the child's biological father. 

Both the mother and the man were charged in connection with the case and are before court.

In the case on Wednesday morning, Colonel Langa Mhlongo, who testified in the sentencing proceedings for the mother, said he had tried to quantify how much was spent on the search but had given up.

The mother last month admitted to lying about the “kidnapping” and pleaded guilty to charges of fraud, defeating the administration of justice and making a false statement.

The case also trended on social media as dozens prayed for the child's safe return following public appeals made by the woman and the woman's s husband.

Then two days later, police pulled a vehicle over at the Mariannhill Toll Plaza and found the baby, with a man now understood to be her mother’s lover and her biological father.

The man's case is back in court next month.
