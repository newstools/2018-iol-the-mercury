Cosatu has weighed in on the alleged shooting of a farm worker at a funeral in New Hanover last week.
The trade union said in a statement that the suspect – identified as a farmer – would be appearing at court on Tuesday.
The Mercury reported a week ago that the 66-year-old man was expected to appear in court for allegedly killing another man during a funeral in Cramond, near Pietermaritzburg.
The police said at the time that the Lembethe family had been conducting a funeral in Ottos Bluff when the suspect showed up with a firearm, and shot a 30-year-old man.

“It is distasteful and hurtful that the killing happened at the funeral, something we regard as the most sacred ceremony where the bereaved family is afforded a last chance to show love, mourn and humbly send off of one of their own who is departing for good. The action is inhumane ... disrespectful and very undermining, especially to the family, workers and friends of the deceased.”
The union was “vehemently opposed” to the granting of the bail by the court. 
They said that, in taking the decision, the court needed to bear in mind the fresh incident, where another farmer shot dead a farm worker at Krugersdorp.
