New Year’s Eve took a tragic turn for one family, when an eight-year-old boy and a 39-year-old relative of his were washed out to sea in Umkomaas, on the South Coast.

The pair was on a rubber duck in the lagoon, when they became caught in the current.

Their raft capsized in the surf and scuba divers aboard a nearby charter boat came to their aid.

They managed to pull the boy to safety but the man disappeared beneath the water.

Police divers from the Durban and Port Shepstone Search and Rescue units – along with various other emergency personnel from ER24, Medevac, Umkomaas SAPS and the Road Traffic Inspectorate as well as eThekwini lifeguards and Metro police officers – responded to the scene.

ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring said when they found the man, he had been unresponsive.

Paramedics started CPR but, after 45 minutes, he was still not showing any signs of life and he was declared dead. Meiring said the boy was taken to hospital.

Another boy – aged just four-years-old – was hospitalised, after nearly drowning at a pool, near an uMhlanga Beach, on New Year’s Eve.

Netcare 911’s Shawn Herbst said reports from the scene indicated that the child had been found floating in a pool and that bystanders pulled him out.

Lifeguards were called to the scene and, upon finding the child unresponsive with no pulse, started CPR on him.

A Netcare 911 emergency care practitioner arrived a short time later and took over.

“A pulse was regained and the child was immediately transported to hospital in a critical condition for further assessment and care,” Herbst said.
