Three suspects have been arrested after a high speed chase and shootout in the Avoca area on Wednesday morning. 
Marshall Security said in a statement that they had been alerted to a house breaking in Figtree Rise, in the suburb of Glen Anil, north of Durban. 
“Details from the scene indicated that four armed suspects forced entry into a home, whilst the homeowners were away, ransacking the premises, making off with televisions, jewellery and other items.”
The suspects were also reported to have fled the scene in a white Toyota Fortuner, as reported by The Mercury earlier on Wednesday. 
“A description and registration of the vehicle was circulated to all vehicles in the area and the suspects were spotted fleeing down Old North Coast Road towards Chris Hani Road by Marshall Security armed response officers.”

The suspects, they said, began driving at high speed in an effort to evade arrest. 
“Members of the SAPS Flying Squad unit joined the pursuit and a shootout ensued as the armed suspects opened fire on the police, resulting in a male suspect sustaining a gunshot wound to his leg.” 
In an effort to evade arrest, the suspects turned into a nearby service station where they alighted from the vehicle and attempted to flee on foot, when they were intercepted and apprehended by police and the security company. 


“Three firearms, live ammunition, a two-way radio, various house breaking implements as well as property confirmed to have been stolen from the premises in Glen Anil, were all recovered in the vehicle.”
