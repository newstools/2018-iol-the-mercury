NSRI Durban station commander Clifford Ireland said in a statement that at 9.15am duty crew had been activated by the Transnet National Ports Authority (TNPA) following a request for assistance from the vessel, with 12 crew onboard, reporting motor mechanical failure 10 nautical miles, or (18.5km) from the Port of Durban.
“We launched the sea rescue craft Eikos Rescuer II and, on arrival on the scene, a tow line was rigged and they were towed to port without incident and, once safely in port, no further assistance was required.”

Ireland said that during the operation NSRI Durban had been alerted to the harbour fishing ski-boat Zaki reporting to be taking water.
“The skipper confirmed that he was confident he would make it back to the Fynnlands Angling Club unassisted and NSRI remained on alert until they reported to be safe at the club and no further assistance was required.”
