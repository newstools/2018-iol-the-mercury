The arrest was made on the Almond Bridge which crosses the N2.The incident was widely shared on social media but it could not be confirmed whether or not he had been taken into police custody.According to kznwatch, when asked why he had thrown stones, the man said that he did it to earn some money. He said a tow truck driver, who was not named, had promised to pay him to do it. This could not be confirmed.The Mercury has contacted the police for comment on this matter and whether the man was arrested by SAPS, and is awaiting their response.The province, particularly the stretch of the N2 between Durban and Ballito has been a hot spot for rock throwing incidents.
