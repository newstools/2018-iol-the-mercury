Wide awake police who spotted a vehicle in KwaNdengezi that had been hijacked earlier gave chase and arrested one suspect. Another man escaped and is being sought by police. The arrested man was accused, along with the other suspect, of accosting a 63-year-old woman earlier on Monday who was seated inside her parked Ford Ranger bakkie. The suspects pulled out weapons and robbed the victim of her vehicle. A case of carjacking was opened for investigation at Mpumalanga SAPS. Later, Chatsworth SAPS members spotted the vehicle at Tafelkop, in the KwaNdengezi area, tracked the vehicle and gave chase.  Captain Nqobile Gwala said the suspects opened fire at police, who returned fire.  “One of the suspects jumped out of the moving car and rolled down a cliff. The suspect, 23, was apprehended and taken to hospital for medical attention where he is being held under police guard. The other suspect managed to flee on foot having abandoned the vehicle.” Gwala said the arrested suspect would appear in the Pinetown Magistrate’s Court on charges of carjacking and attempted murder. The KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Commissioner, Major General Bheki Langa praised the members for their quick response in apprehending the suspect and the recovery of the stolen vehicle. “We are confident that the suspect who evaded the police arrest will be apprehended soon,” he said.
