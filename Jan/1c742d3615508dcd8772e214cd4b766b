The crime weary community of Umshwathi outside Pietermaritzburg protested outside the New Hanover Magistrate’s Court on Monday morning where two men accused of stabbing an elderly woman to death appeared.The two men allegedly attacked June Butler on Thursday last week. They appeared in court for a bail application but their case was remanded to next week.Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said, “The suspects face charges of murder and house robbery. It is alleged that on 4 January 2018 at 6am, a 78-year-old woman was attacked by unknown suspects while at her house in Cramond.“They stabbed her and took the TV set, cellphone and a handbag before fleeing the scene. The Cramond police started their investigation and two suspects aged 26 and 28 were arrested,” she said.Ward councillor and the Deputy Mayor of Umshwathi Municipality, Pro Dlamini, said the community organised the protest against the suspects being granted bail because they do not want them back in the community. He said the suspects were found in possession of some of Butler’s belongings.“We are saying we do not want this (crime and killings) in our community, irrespective of the colour of the person who has been killed.“Last week we were also in the court protesting against bail being granted to a white farmer that had been accused of killing a black person,” he said.
