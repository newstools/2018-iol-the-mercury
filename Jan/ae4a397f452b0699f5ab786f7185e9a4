A group of unknown men armed with guns robbed a jewellery store at the Bluff Towers centre on the Bluff on Monday.The police said at about 2pm the men took the jewellery at gunpoint and fled. While fleeing, they allegedly fired several shots but no injuries were reported and the jewellery was recovered outside the premises. “They allegedly hijacked the vehicle to use for their getaway and it was later found abandoned in the Durban CBD. A case of business robbery was opened at Brighton Beach police station and no arrest has been made,” said police spokesperson captain Nqobile Gwala. The management of the centre declined to speak to The Mercury, only confirming that there was an incident. They said they were waiting for the police report and once that was done would release a statement. The Southlands Sun reported that a woman shopper who was in the mall said everybody started running into the shops to take cover when they heard gunfire.“I commend the police for their quick response. Everything seems to be under control but it was such a scary experience,” said the shopper.
