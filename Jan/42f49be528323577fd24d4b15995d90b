Two women have been injured during a robbery in Stanger on Tuesday.
And, said paramedics, the five-year-old child of one of the victims witnessed the attack.
Netcare 911 spokesperson Shawn Herbst said that at approximately 1.54pm, they had received information that two people had been injured in a robbery that had occurred on Hulett Street.
“Paramedics were immediately dispatched to the scene and on arrival found that two women, a 26- and 37-year-old, had both sustained traumatic injuries to the head and upper torso after they had been assaulted with what is believed to be a blunt object in an alleged robbery.”

Herbst said that the five-year-old girl, believed to be the daughter of the 26-year-old woman, had witnessed the robbery and, although she had not been physically injured in the attack, the child was visibly traumatised.
He said that both patients had been treated on scene and transported to hospital for further assessment and care.
“The motive behind the robbery is unknown but police were on scene and will be investigating.”
