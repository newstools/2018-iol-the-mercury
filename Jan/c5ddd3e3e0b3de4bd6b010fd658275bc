Durban - The eThekwini municipality is looking at fitting the city’s “hot spot” bridges with steel cages, in a bid to curb rock-throwing.
The municipality said in a statement on Monday that it was also considering the use of closed-circuit cameras.
As recently as the weekend, a 26-year-old man had been discharged from hospital, after he was injured in an alleged rock throwing incident on Saturday night.
And, last month, a seven-year-old boy and his older sister were killed, after a boulder was allegedly thrown from a bridge and landed on the car they were travelling in.
“We are investigating the possibility of installing safety barriers in the form of steel cages to prevent objects being thrown from overhead bridges,” deputy mayor Fawzia Peer said in the statement.
She said the proposal would feature as an “urgent item” on the agenda of the municipality’s Safety and Emergency Committee – which she also chairs – this year.

But, the deputy mayor said, these kinds of measures could not be implemented “overnight” and “normal council processes” would have to be followed.
“It will also depend on funding,” said Peer.
She said a risk assessment would be carried out, to identify hot spots.

“And a task team will be formed by the municipality to oversee the implementation of all proposed interventions,” she said, “This includes ensuring increased police visibility”.
The deputy mayor said her offices were “very concerned” about an increase in reports of rock-throwing incidents and wanted to reassure the public that they acting swiftly to find “a lasting solution” to the problem.
“We will be speaking to communities in areas where these incidents have occurred and encouraging them to work with the city and report those that are responsible for these criminal acts,” Peer said.
