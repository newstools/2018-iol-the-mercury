Police have noticed an increase in the hijacking of vehicles – being used in transport service Uber – in and around Durban. 
They said in a statement on Wednesday that, recently, the driver of an Uber had been dropping off his client in the Greenwood Park area when he was approached by three suspects who were waiting in their vehicle. 
“The driver was allegedly shot and wounded and his vehicle was taken away. A case of attempted murder and hijacking was opened at Greenwood Park police station.”
 They appealed to the owners of vehicles used for Uber to take extra precautions when using their vehicles.
Last week, The Mercury reported that police were urging Taxify, Uber and metered taxi drivers to be cautious of criminals posing as clients.
“SAPS are warning Uber, Taxify and metered taxi drivers to be on high alert, especially in the KwaMashu area, after a number of robbery incidents where criminals pretended to be clients to be fetched from restaurants or nightclubs and taken to the KwaMashu area,” police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane said at the time.
He said once the taxi drivers arrived at the destination, they were held up and robbed.
