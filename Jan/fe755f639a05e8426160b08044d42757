A small child has drowned in what appears to be a rudimentary reservoir, on a property in Groutville, north of Durban.
IPSS Medical Rescue spokesperson Paul Herbst said on Tuesday afternoon that paramedics had raced to the scene and pulled the four-year-old girl from the water but there was nothing they could for her.

“She was declared deceased at the scene,” Herbst said.
Another little girl who was seen with the deceased on Tuesday, was initially thought to be missing but she was later found hiding inside a nearby house.

The incidents had taken place in Richards Bay, La Mercy and Pietermaritzburg.
One of the victims drowned when the bank of the La Mercy lagoon broke open. 
His body was recovered and an inquest opened.
