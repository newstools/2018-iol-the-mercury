A self-confessed paedophile from the KwaZulu-Natal South Coast will remain out on bail until at least April.
The man – who cannot be identified to protect the identity of his victim, who is also his daughter – appeared in the Port Shepstone Magistrate’s Court, on Wednesday.
His matter was set down for sentencing proceedings but high-profile advocate Christo van Schalkwyk, who is representing the man, requested a postponement.
Van Schalkwyk told the court the defence intended to present the evidence of a clinical psychologist and had instructed her to compile a report.
His client pleaded guilty to being in possession of 277 images of child pornography, sexually assaulting his five-year-old daughter and using the girl to create illicit material, back in August 2017.

At the time, he said he suffered from “at least four recognisable mental disorders”.
These, he said, included an antisocial personality disorder, a substance abuse disorder, paedophilia and a dependent personality disorder.
Van Schalkwyk said he had only received the final draft of the clinical psychologist’s report on Tuesday night and that he had not yet been able to give the State a copy.
The matter was postponed until April and the man’s bail, extended until then.
