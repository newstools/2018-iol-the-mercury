KwaZulu-Natal Health MEC Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo has cautioned social media users against falling prey to a bogus Facebook page which had been fraudulently established in his name.
“It has come to the MEC’s attention that the administrator of the page is involved in fraudulent activities, including reportedly successfully selling a non-running car to an unsuspecting social media user,” Dhlomo said in a statement.
Dhlomo's official Facebook page was managed and run by the KZN Department of Health’s Corporate Communications Unit and, he said, the other page had misspelled his surname as “Dlomo”. 
“The fake page also lists MEC Dhlomo as an employee of the Western Cape Department of Health, and falsely states that he studied at Cape Peninsula University of Technology, went to Cebisa Secondary School, and lives in Cape Town.”
He said although the fake page had been reported to the administrators of Facebook, it was yet to be taken down.
