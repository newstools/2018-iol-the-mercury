The Ugu Municipality, which has battled a raft of water issues in recent months, announced a shutdown of the water mains to Umtentweni on Tuesday. In a notice on its Facebook page, "Ugu Municipality Talk", it said that it was informing residents of Umtentweni, parts of Sea Park and parts of Southport of an emergency shutdown of supply for the emergency installation of new pipelines and new valves. This, it said, followed a resolution taken by Water Services management to have aged infrastructure replaced, which were believed to be causing supply interruptions in these communities since the festive season started. A spokesperson for the municipality said, with groundwork completed by 6pm and - if there were no other contributing factors discovered - water supply would resume by 9pm at the earliest. “We will be filling up the Melville Reservoir during the shutdown of the supply main to Umtentweni area which will allow adequate build-up of water supply for this reservoir.Water shutdown on KZN south coast“This will allow the reinstatement of normal water supply to Melville, Pumula and Umzumbe areas by tomorrow, January 3, 2018. High-lying areas of these communities should be fully restored later that day.”The municipality said it was aware of the communities’ frustration and was doing everything possible to restore normal operations. On December 27, The Mercury reported that those living in Umtentweni, Sea Park, Southport, Melville and Pumula were experiencing “major challenges” with the northern system which remained under severe strain thus causing sporadic supply and no water at all in some parts of the mentioned areas.Earlier, services in parts of Ugu were affected by a standoff between workers and the municipality. Workers were objecting to paying for a benefit that they did not want. This was recently resolved when the workers were paid back for contributions they had made.Agreement to ease water woes
