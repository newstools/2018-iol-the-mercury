PIETERMARITZBURG - Eight sealed coffins lined the Aryan Hall in Raisethorpe, Pietermaritzburg, on Friday – with photographs to remember the family that perished in a horrific N2 crash last week.Titus Mahabeer, 3, his siblings, Leah, 6, Hannah, 7, Isabella, 11, his parents, Mitchell, 43, and Veroshnie, 34, his grandmother, Lorraine Rampersadh, 57, and his uncle, Jesse Mahabeer, 22, were killed in the crash near Umzumbe on the KZN South Coast, caused by a 63-year-old allegedly drunk driver.Church of the Redeemed pastor, Bruce Allan, said the family had always been jovial. They had been heading home from Margate, where they had celebrated a birthday over the weekend. Allan questioned whether fate would have been different for two other members of the family, Mahabeer’s children from his first marriage, who he said had been close to their father.Daughters Chole, 13, and Reece, 11, did not get permission from their mother, Mandy, to go along.“If the girls had gone with their father, two vehicles would have been used,” said Bruce.Their VW Golf was a mangled wreck at the scene. The driver of the other vehicle, a Ford Ranger, was not hurt.Anastasios Peyios appeared in the Port Shepstone Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday. He was granted R5 000 bail and the case was adjourned to May.The funeral was held at the Mountain Rise crematorium.SUNDAY TRIBUNE
