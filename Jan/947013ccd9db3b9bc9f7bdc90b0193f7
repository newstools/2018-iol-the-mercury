Police have opened a case of culpable homicide, she said, adding that all team members had been questioned.The hunting party had already killed one lion and were tracking others when the incident occurred, she said. It was not clear who fired the fatal shot."(It's) not like they were firing at something, it was really just an accident," Van der Linden added.
