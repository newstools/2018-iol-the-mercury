Cebolenkosi Gift Philani Ntuli appeared before the Durban Magistrate’s Court on Monday morning, when the State announced he was facing a raft of charges.
These included kidnapping, murder, contravening the firearms control act, reckless and negligent driving, defeating the ends of justice and fraud.
And, the State said, more charges could follow.
Ntuli was remanded into custody until early next month, for further investigations.

In the meantime, magistrate Mahomed Motala ordered Ntuli’s photograph could not be published as further identity parades could take place and it could jeopardise the State’s case at this stage.
Lee, 20, disappeared from her workplace, an alleged brothel, in Margaret Maytom Drive, Durban North, on the afternoon of January 4.
A week later, a relative identified a burnt body, found in a sugarcane field, in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands, as Lee’s.
Ntuli was then arrested at his Assagay home, last Wednesday afternoon.
