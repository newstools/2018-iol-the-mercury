A cyclist has received medical treatment for her injuries after being hit by a motorist on Thursday morning.
Netcare 911 spokesperson Shawn Herbst said in a statement that at approximately 9.30am, they received information that a cyclist had been knocked down on the M4, southbound, near Blue Lagoon bridge.
“Reports from the scene indicate that the cyclist – a woman, 30 years of age – was hit by a hatchback while cycling near the promenade.”

He said that the victim had suffered injuries to her back and lower limbs and had been transported to hospital in a stable condition.
“The Durban Metro Police were on scene and will be investigating.”
The safety of cyclists on the roads came under the spotlight a year ago after two cyclists were killed after being hit by the driver of a car – who had allegedly been drinking.
