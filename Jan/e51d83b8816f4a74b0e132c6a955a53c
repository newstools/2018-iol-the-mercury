Two secondary collisions have taken place, following the overturning of a car on the M7 on Tuesday morning.
Rescue Care’s Garrith Jamieson said in a statement that the driver of the vehicle had overturned it on the Durban-bound side of the highway, just past the N3 onramp.
“While the medical and emergency personnel had been on the scene attending to the overturned vehicle, another vehicle came through and collided with the tow trucks and the vehicles that had slowed down.”
He said that a third collision had occurred, where two trucks collided into each other.
Three people had sustained injuries.
“Traffic is slowly trickling past the accident.”
In November last year, two men had been killed when a taxi they were travelling in rolled down an embankment off the M7 eastbound in Pinetown.
On Monday, emergency services reported that 16 people had been left injured following a collision between a light motor vehicle and a taxi on the N2 in eManzimtoti.
