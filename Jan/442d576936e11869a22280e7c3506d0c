National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) Shelly Beach station commander Jeremiah Jackson said in a statement that on Sunday at 1pm, during a routine training exercise, two of their sea rescue craft, Shelly Spirit and Spirit of Dawn, diverted to respond to Oslo Beach – a beach not attended by lifeguards – three kilometres north of Shelly Beach, following reports of a drowning in progress.
“Med-Evac EMS and a South African Police Search and Rescue unit also responded.”

Jackson said that upon arrival, Med-Evac launched their rescue craft, Gods Grace, to join the NSRI sea rescue craft searching for the 20-year-old local male missing in the surf after appearing to be swept out to sea by rip currents while swimming with his brother and disappearing beneath the surf.
“Despite an extensive sea and shoreline search, in a 2- to 2.5-meter swell and breaking surf, there was no sign of the missing man and police will continue with an ongoing search operation.”
