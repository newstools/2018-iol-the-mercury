The labour strike had the Durban University of Technology turned violent on Wednesday morning, when the institution's security guards allegedly shot at striking workers with rubber bullets.
The strike which has entered its second week has reached a deadlock with management offering 6.25% increment and no bonus, while unions want at least 8.25%. 
Union members, who spoke to The Mercury, said security guards opened fire on them when they were leaving Cane Growers Hall, after being briefed by union leaders on the day’s plan and that students were also reportedly shot.
The striking workers said that they had not provoked the guards.
Spokesperson for the Crisis Committee, Milton Estrice, appointed to facilitate negotiations between the two parties said that the Deputy Minister of Education’ visit had forced the university to reopen negotiation talks.
“We came in good faith to meet with management but we were hit with a two fold blow, our members' peaceful protest has been mired but today’s shootings  despite the workers not threatening or harming anyone, and the workers mandate was not met, management came with an insulting offer to the table,” explained Estrice.
According to Estrice, sixteen staff members were reported to have been injured and two students were also hurt.
Estrice said strike action would continue.
DUT management were not immediately available for comment.
