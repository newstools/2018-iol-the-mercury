Numerous rescuers worked tirelessly to help an injured dog – believed to have been frightened by fireworks and then hit by a car – on the M13 at Fields Hill. 
The dog was spotted by a motorist on the busy stretch of road on Sunday night – New Year’s Eve – said Community News Network TV via their Facebook page.
“Pet Rescue Pinetown, an animal rescue network site received the information and began networking it amongst its 5000-member network. The aim was to try and find its owner.”
Shortly after this went out, they said, another report had been received that a dog had been run over on Fields Hill.
“Patrollers went to the scene and found the dog which was spotted earlier. (It) was assumed that it was dead.”

The Kloof SPCA responded when it emerged that the dog had been injured, but not killed. 
Pet Rescue Pinetown and Harry's Pet Rescue used a microchip scanner and identified the dog and contacted its owner, who was reportedly overseas and had not been aware of the incident.
“The dog had somehow escaped from its property and, in the ensuing chaos of fireworks displays, ended up on the notorious freeway.”
ER24 via their Facebook page said that the dog had been frightened by the fireworks and ran into the road, getting hit by a vehicle.
They transported the animal to a SPCA in Kloof for treatment.
