Two people have been killed, and another injured, in a bakkie crash in Ntuzuma in the early hours of Sunday morning.
Netcare 911 KwaZulu-Natal spokesperson Shawn Herbst said in a statement that, at approximately 12.30am, they had received information that a collision had occurred on Bhungane Road in Ntuzuma’s F-section.
“Reports from the scene indicate that the driver of a bakkie with two other occupants had lost control on the main road when the vehicle left the road impacting the wall of a house.”
He said that the wall appeared to have remained intact but the bakkie had been crushed, trapping two of the occupants in the mangled wreck.
“The two trapped occupants were declared deceased on arrival by paramedics and a third occupant whose condition is unknown, was transported to hospital prior to the arrival of emergency services.”
He said that the eThekwini Fire and Rescue team had to use the “Jaws of Life” to remove the occupants trapped in the bakkie.
