“An 11-year-old boy from Vryheid spent two nights at the overnight facility when the taxi he was travelling in left without him on its return to home. He has since been successfully reunited with his family.”
They said that on Sunday December 31, 2017, a drowning occurred at uMkhomazi River where an adult got on a home-made floating device which subsequently sank. 
“A three-year old was rescued during the incident. On Saturday, January 6, 2018, a man drowned at La Mercy Lagoon during high tide when he attempted to cross the river mouth.”
With just a few days left until end of the festive season, authorities will continue to monitor the beaches.
