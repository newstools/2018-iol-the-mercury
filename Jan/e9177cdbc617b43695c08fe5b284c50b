Mbuso Makhoba, Andile Zulu who are in custody and co-accused Sandile Mzizi, appeared briefly in the Durban High Court on Thursday. 

It was expected that they would hear their fate for the May 2013 murder of Cyril Herbet Nkosinathi Zondi, 46, who was gunned down in his home in Umlazi. He was the principal of Nyon'eMhlophe Primary in the Ugu educational district and the  regional chairman of the SA Democratic Teachers' Union (Sadtu) in the lower South Coast region. 

Soon after the murder, three  high ranking department of education officials were arrested but charges were withdrawn after Mzizi reportedly refused to testify against them.

According to court papers, Mzizi and "his associates" conspired to kill Zondi and he was tasked with arranging the hit men.

Mzizi- who is out on bail- was then the school governing body chairman at Khathi High School near Hibberdene.
