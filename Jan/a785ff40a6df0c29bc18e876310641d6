Police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said that on January 13, police had been called to the Pieters area where the SAPS Search and Rescue members retrieved the body of the 17-year-old young man.
Local newspaper Ladysmith Herald reported that the boy and his friends were desperately looking to cool down, after sweltering heat had gripped most parts of Ladysmith and surrounding areas.

“The group went to the local water spot, like always, to cool down. They were trying to cross the river when one of the youngsters just disappeared beneath the water,” said one person at the scene watching the rescue, in the report. 
The paper reported that the Ladysmith K9 Search and Rescue unit’s Warrant Officer Jacques Meter and search dog Emma searched the water, and police took a walk along the river banks to see if they could perhaps spot something that could lead to the recovery of the youth’s body.
