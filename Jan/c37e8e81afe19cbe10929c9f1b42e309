The national union continued their strike, which was held across all DUT campuses over deadlocked wage negotiations.
The union rejected the latest offer of 6%, and instead have been demanding a 10% increase across board; an increase of R400 on their housing allowance; and a once-off R 9 000 bonus. Its members were left waiting at the (DUT) grounds, when the institutions management postponed a meeting, which was to take place at 10.30am, for the afternoon.

“We will wait to hear what offer they bring to the table, however if the offer does not satisfy our members' demands, we will continue with the protest action,” explained NEHAWU's Mike Mbatha.
He further explained that if the union’s demands were not met, their regional office might be forced to intensify the strike and would consider uniting with their UNISA counterparts and embark on a total shutdown of the two facilities.
