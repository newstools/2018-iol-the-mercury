The woman last month pleaded guilty to charges of fraud, defeating the administration of justice and making a false statement.
Sentencing proceedings concluded in the Durban Regional Court on Thursday, with magistrate Anand Maharaj saying the woman needed to understand what she had done was wrong.
He sentenced her to five years in prison and said she would be required to serve at least 10 months of that.

Reports that a month-old baby girl had been abducted from the Durban city centre, last March triggered a large scale search by police, security firms and residents who banded together to look for the girl.
The case also trended on social media as dozens prayed for the child's safe return following public appeals made by the woman and the woman's s husband.
Then two days later, police pulled a vehicle over at the Mariannhill Toll Plaza and found the baby, with a man now understood to be her mother’s lover and her biological father.
It has since emerged that the mother gave the baby to him voluntarily.
The man was also charged. He is due back in court next month.
Meanwhile, the baby spent much of the last year in “crisis care”.
She was returned to her mother last month.
