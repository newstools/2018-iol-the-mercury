Herbst said that the cause of the accident was speculative but it had been suggested that the rider had failed to negotiate the traffic circle.
"Traffic authorities were on scene and will be investigating," he said.
Last month, a biker was killed in an accident on the N3 just outside Pietermaritzburg.
