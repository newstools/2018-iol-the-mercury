The Amanzimtoti resident who came to the rescue of a man who was stabbing himself at a mall on Sunday, says he could not stand by and watch someone die in front of him.

Daniel van Rooijen, 31, who works at a cellular shop at Galleria Mall, can be seen in a video captured by a bystander, wrestling with the unknown man and trying to get the knife out of his hands. This was after attempts to reason with the man came to nought.

Speaking to The Mercury on Tuesday, Van Rooijen said when he reached the spice shop where the incident occurred, most people had run away after the man started acting erratically.

“He was bleeding because he had cut himself a few times already. He was standing by the entrance of the counter and when I approached he moved behind the counter. He had the knife to his neck and just kept poking,” said Van Rooijen.

Van Rooijen initially tried to talk to the man.
“I was pleading with him to put the knife down and talk to me. He was saying stuff in Zulu so I don’t know what he said but all I could say back was khuluma (talk).”

Another man, Zulu-speaking, also tried to talk to the man. He and Van Rooijen can be seen in the video gesturing for the man to calm down.

This went on for a few minutes until the man grabbed a bottle and attempted to hammer the knife deep into his neck.

“I jumped over the counter and grabbed his arm. He was not aggressive but he resisted. Between the blood and the molasses from the broken bottles behind the counter, it was quite slippery so I tried to pin him to the counter and grabbed his wrist to try get the knife away,” said Van Rooijen.

They fell on to the shop floor and another bystander secured the man’s hand with his foot and pried the knife away.

Defeated and out of breath the man “curled up in my arms like a baby”, said Van Rooijen.

The man was cuffed by mall security and was whimpering and crying until paramedics arrived.

Netcare911 spokesman Shawn Herbst said the man was transported to hospital in a stable condition.

While police confirmed the incident, spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said no case was open for investigation as it was an attempt on his own life.

Galleria’s marketing manager Anusha Timul said the shop was able to continue with business soon afterwards.
Attempts to get the man to calm down proved futile.

She denied social media posts claiming that the man had attempted to take his own life after being cornered in a botched robbery.

“He did not threaten or interfere with any staff member or the public. The incident was brought under control quickly and the guy was contained until the ambulance arrived,” said Timul.

Van Rooijen also received medical attention after realising his hand was cut in the struggle for the knife.

“All I know is, that guy was not going to die in front of me,” he said.
