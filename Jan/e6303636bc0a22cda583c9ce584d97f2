Two weeks ago, 16-year-old Amina Haffejee and her 7-year-old brother, Abdur Raheem, were killed when a rock was thrown from a bridge on the N2, near Tongaat, onto the car they were travelling in.
There have been several more incidents reported on various stretches of road in and around Durban since.
And the eThekwini municipality said on Monday that it was considering fitting “hot spot” bridges with steel cages, in a bid to curb rock-throwing.
It also said it was looking into the use of closed-circuit cameras.
