Police have made an appeal to the community to be cautious when purchasing items advertised on the internet or in newspapers.
They said in a statement on Wednesday that police in the Umgungundlovu North Cluster had been witnessing an increase in fraud cases where vehicles were advertised in the newspapers and on online classifieds website Gumtree, but the sales had been fraudulent. 
“Innocent victims are falling prey to these advertisements and depositing money into accounts that fraudsters have set up without viewing the vehicles or establishing the legitimacy of the sale.”

They said that, in a recent case, the victim deposited R13 800 into an account for a Toyota Run-X that was advertised. 
“When the vehicle was not delivered to her, she made inquiries and realised that the company did not exist and the sale was fraudulent.”
They warned: “The authenticity of the sales must be verified before making any payments and payments can only be exchanged with the item during the trade.”
They said that victims were often pressured to deposit the money immediately by being told that there were several offers to purchase and that the item would no longer be available if they hesitated. 
“Out of desperation to buy the item, they fall prey to fraudsters.”
