A North Coast toddler has died after being electrocuted.
Netcare 911 spokesperson Shawn Herbst said that at approximately 1.40pm, they received a call for assistance from a private ambulance service.
He said that the two-year-old child had been electrocuted at the Ocean Drive Inn settlement in Tongaat on the KwaZulu-Natal North coast.

It is believed that the child had made contact with the exposed power supply by the injuries that were present, he said.
"A Netcare 911 Emergency Care Practitioner had started an Advanced Life Support resuscitation but, despite best efforts, the child was unfortunately declared deceased on scene."
Members of the Tongaat SAPS were in scene and will be investigating, said Herbst.
