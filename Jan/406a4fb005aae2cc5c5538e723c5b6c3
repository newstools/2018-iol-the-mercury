Three men had been launching on a small boat to go spearfishing when the vessel capsized in the surfline on the KwaZulu-Natal South Coast.
This prompted the National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) to launch a rescue attempt.
NSRI Rocky Bay station commander Kevin Fourie said in a statement that at approximately 6am on Monday, duty crew had been activated following a report to NSRI Durban of a boat capsized in the surf at Umkomaas.
“Rocky Bay crew members who live in the area responded directly to the scene and on arrival on the scene found the men coming ashore. They were not injured.”

He said that their boat had been recovered onto the beach from shallow surf.
“Once their boat was recovered no further assistance was required.”
At the weekend, the NSRI had been activated by the Transnet National Ports Authority (TNPA) following a request for assistance from a vessel, with 12 crew onboard, reporting motor mechanical failure 10 nautical miles, or (18.5km) from the Port of Durban.
