Announcing the preliminary 2016/2017 festive season report in Pretoria on Monday, Transport Minister Joe Maswanganyi said between December 1 and January 9, 1 527 people were killed on the roads compared to 1 714 in the same period last year. This was an 11% decline, surpassing the target of 10%. 
“We recognise that the successes we have achieved this year would not have been possible without the dedication and commitment of our traffic officers and members,” said Maswanganyi.

Of those killed on the roads, the most, 37% were pedestrians, an increase from 34%. Drivers accounted for 27% of deaths compared to 23% in the previous period. 
“However, there was a decline in passenger fatalities...which indicates that it is possible to save more lives if more people use their safety belts,” he said.
Maswanganyi declared 2018, the year of improved road safety in South Africa.
