Equatorial GuineaOil-rich Equatorial Guinea is struggling to adapt to the lower price of oil. Oil and gas is central to the country’s growth.

It has increased $488 million since 2015.The West African state also faced several attempted coups. The latest attempted coup took place late last month with approximately 30 armed men from Chad, Cameroon and the Central African Republic.They were found with rocket launchers, rifles and ammunition just over the border in Cameroon. The country experienced similar attempts in 2008 and 2004. Haiti This Caribbean country has been plagued with natural disasters in recent years.
