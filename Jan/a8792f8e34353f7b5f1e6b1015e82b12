Durban - KwaZulu-Natal based aid relief organisation, the Gift of the Givers has launched "Operation Cape Town" in an attempt to "push back Day Zero". It is helping collect water from residents of KwaZulu-Natal to help ease the water woes in the Mother City. There are less than 80 days left before Day Zero when most of the taps in Cape Town will be shut off and residents forced to queue at 200 water collection points for their 25 litres of water a day.#WEF #WaterCrisis: Cape Town used as example for climate change emergencyThe organisation said besides installing boreholes in the Western Cape it was also collecting 5L sealed bottles of water.
