Durban - A 33-year-old ANC activist was shot dead in eSikhawini, on the KwaZulu-Natal north coast on Wednesday night. 

Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said a man had opened fire on Mlambo while the deceased was offloading goods at the eMpembeni area.

Mlambo was a secretary of the ANC’s ward 13 branch in eSikhawini.

“Last night at about 7pm, Sifiso Derrick Mlambo was asked by someone to deliver goods at the Empembeni area. While offloading the goods an unknown man opened fire fatally wounding him.”

The suspect then fled the scene in a getaway vehicle, Mbhele said.  

The ANC’s regional leaders said they were going to visit Mlambo's family on Thursday morning.

“We are on our way to see the family, it is only after that when we will be able to give more information because right now we have very little information,” said Tholi Gwala, the secretary of the ANC at the Musa Dladla region.

The police said they were still investigating the murder and had not yet established the motive for the attack.
