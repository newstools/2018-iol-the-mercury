Durban - The African Farmers’ Association of South Africa (Afasa) in the North West is “going after” former president Jacob Zuma demanding he return the R1.5million gift of a herd of cattle he received from the North West Premier Supra Mahumapelo.
The agricultural union said the gift was unjustifiable, corrupt and was to the detriment of emerging farmers. It was recently reported that Mahumapelo gave Zuma a herd of cattle worth about R1.5m as a gift and paid for it using public funds.

Wisdom Matsheka, Afasa secretary in the North West said they wanted the herd back. 

“There is a meeting that has been planned in the coming week with the provincial department of agriculture. At that meeting we will set the time frames of when this herd should be returned.

“We feel that while the Hawks are investigating this matter, we want that herd returned.  

“We understand that he was given 24 pregnant cattle and one bull, those cattle have since calved and we therefore want all of them brought back. 

“That means about 49 cattle should be brought back and given to North West emerging farmers.  

He said people had been misled about the cattle when it was given away. 

“Initially when this herd was given away, people told lies and said this was to benefit the local chiefs. It was only when the truth emerged that people started confessing that this had been given to Zuma as a gift,” he said.

Presidential spokesperson Vukile Mathabela said he was not aware of the 
demands by the North West Afasa.
