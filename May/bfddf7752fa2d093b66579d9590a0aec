Another Taxify driver has been found murdered, and his car torched, in an open veld in Joburg.
Moipolai “Heavy” Sekati, 44, was found on Thursday after he went missing while on duty on Wednesday night. 

The alarm was raised by his cousin Donald Senwelo yesterday morning when ­Sekati didn’t come home from work. Sekati’s murder comes after another Taxify driver, Siyabonga Ngcobo, 21, of Inanda in Durban, was burnt and killed in Pretoria in March.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

Dobsonville police spokesperson Captain Mbulaheni Netshivhodza said Sekati’s car was tracked to Snake Park, where residents saw something burning in an open field at about 8pm on Wednesday. 

He said when they found Sekati, he had two gunshot wounds and had been badly assaulted. 

The officer said police were investigating a case of murder and malicious damage to property. 

“Right now we can’t say if the killing was related to the taxi issue, but we will investigate all leads.” 

Angela Leboa, who owns the car Sekati drove, said he was like family to her.

Sekati lived two houses from Leboa’s family home, and he drove her 5-year-old daughter to ballet classes and her ­injured mother to hospital for check-ups. 

“The last time the family saw him was when he picked up my daughter and took her to ballet class. I don’t know how I am going to tell her that he is dead,” Leboa said. 

Leboa employed Sekati last year, and said he loved the job. 

“He never complained. The only time we ever had problems was over Lent when his phone was stolen by a passenger. At that time I told him we should stop ­operating, but he wanted to continue,” she said.

A Taxify spokesperson said the company was working hard to ­improve driver safety.
