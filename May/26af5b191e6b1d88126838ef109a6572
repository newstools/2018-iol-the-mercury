Sadia Sukhraj was shot in the abdomen and died minutes later. 

Angered by the crime in the community, residents gathered at the police station. By the late afternoon, violent clashes played out between residents and police.

Police spokesperson, Captain Nqobile Gwala, said they strongly condemned the protest.

“They were burning tyres, blockaded the road with burning tyres and hurled objects at the station premises. Police had to use stun grenade to disperse the unruly crowd,” she said. 

Gwala appealed to residents to exercise their right to protest peacefully, by communicating their grievances in a peaceful manner. 

She said there are community leaders within the community who must also be used by community members to engage in a peaceful talks or meetings with police. 

“The protest of whatever nature should be conducted in a peaceful manner and within the rule of the law. We will continue to act firmly against any acts of violence directed to any human being or that results in the destruction of the property. The police vehicles were also damaged during the violent protest on Monday,” she said. 
Acting Provincial Commissioner, Lieutenant General Nhlandla Mkhwanazi, had a meeting with station management at the Chatsworth police station. He had directed management to submit a plan to him on how they will deploy manpower and vehicles to ensure increased police visibility in the area. 
Meanwhile, residents gathered outside the court on Tuesday morning, demanding that those arrested be released.
