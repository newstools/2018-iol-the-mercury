Police spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbhele, said on February 3, the 34-year-old driver was dropping off a passenger in KwaMashu's J Section when he was ordered to stop next to a group of men who were standing at the side of the road. 

"At gunpoint, the driver was robbed of his car and personal belongings. He was then taken to an ATM machine where an undisclosed amount of cash was withdrawn from his bank account. A case of robbery and carjacking was opened at the KwaMashu police station and two men, aged 27 and 29, were arrested," Mbhele said. 

She said the two men were also linked to another car hijacking incidents of Uber drivers that occurred in April 2018 in KwaMashu, Greenwood Park and Sydenham policing areas.
 
KwaZulu-Natal Acting Provincial Commissioner, Major General Bheki Langa applauds the action taken by the police to secure the arrest. 

“The team will continue to work around the clock to ensure that the other perpetrators of similar crimes are arrested to face the Criminal Justice System,” he said.
