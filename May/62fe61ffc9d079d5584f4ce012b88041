Durban - The Department of Education has launched a probe into allegations of fraud and corruption at a Durban school. The probe comes after damning claims were made about activities at the George Campbell School of Technology. The investigation is expected to be completed in ten working days.

Department spokesperson, Kwazi Mthethwa said the information that has reached the department cited governance and management issues at the school and relates to fraud, corruption, irregularities with regards to SGB elections, unauthorised payment of incentives to educators and theft.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

"Information coming from any member of the public cannot be neglected especially if it points to issues of financial mismanagement. It is against this very reason that the Head of Department of Education in KwaZulu-Natal Dr Enoch Nzama has appointed a team from head office to conduct a preliminary investigation at the school and further provide a report with recommendations," he said. 

Mthethwa said given the seriousness of the matters raised, the department could not divulge further details to protect those who are involved in the matter.

"We urge all affected officials and individuals to cooperate with the investigating team during the investigation as the province wishes to know the truth. The Department of Education will take stern action on those responsible if the claims are found to be true," Mthethwa said. 

Last year, the school made headlines after pupils went on rampage, claiming that they were racially abused by staff at the school.
