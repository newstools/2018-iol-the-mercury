A police officer is in hot water and facing a case of crimen injuria for his alleged racist post on social media.
ANCYL Provincial Executive Committee member Percy Sithole has opened a case at the Heidelberg police department after one of its officers began posting allegedly racist remarks on his Facebook profile. 

The officer, Riaan van Rensburg, shared a series of Facebook posts that later sparked outrage on social media.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

One post shared from the white nationalist political party Front National Facebook page depicts a group of baboons seated in congress, which Van Rensburg captioned “ANC and EFF”.

He also comments, “Planet of the apes in South Africa!” 

In another post Van Rensburg writes, “You just can’t get the forest and blockhead out of him!!” in response to rioters at the Chiefs vs Free State Stars soccer match that turned violent.

Sithole said the comments “cannot be allowed, especially when the person is a public servant”.

Sithole was backed by an angry chorus of supporters on social media. 

@MhloaPhiwe tweeted: “It’s amazing a so-called police officer in Heidelberg GP can say such.”

The ANCYL also said it was in full support of Sithole’s case. 

“This is but a clear signal of what we have long been saying regarding the urgent need for the security cluster to be transformed,” said ANCYL spokesperson Mbali Hlophe.

“Racists who worked under the criminal apartheid system remain within our institutions and in this era much like in apartheid continue to treat our people with great disdain.” 

Gauteng police spokesperson Captain Kay Makhubela said this was an isolated case and did not think it was part of a wider problem in SAPS.

“We have opened a case of crimen injuria and it will be taken to court,” Makhubela said. 

“There will be an internal investigation that will be opened about the conduct of the officer.”

Sithole said he hoped by opening the case he could have Van Rensburg prosecuted.
