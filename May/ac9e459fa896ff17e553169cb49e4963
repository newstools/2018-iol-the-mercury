Durban - The more than a dozen political parties represented in Parliament and provincial legislatures will share nearly R150million in 2018/19.
The Electoral Commission of SA (IEC) announced that the 15 political parties will share just about R149m as part of the government's funding of organisations with public representatives.

This year's allocation is R8m more compared with the last financial year's R140.7m.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

The millions are distributed through the Represented Political Parties' Fund, which is managed by the IEC. 

The ANC received the lion's share of the R134m allocated to political parties in 2016/17 with over R79.4m, while the DA got nearly R29m and the EFF was allocated about R11m.

The governing party spent most of its allocation on salaries, which set it back more than R52.5m.

Its second most costly item was the arrangement of meetings and rallies at just under R20m.

DA's largest expenditure item was also salaries, which accounted for R25.6m.

EFF spent R7.7m of its R11m on rallies and events and another R1.9m on promotions and publications.

The windfall comes as Parliament is in the final leg of processing legislation to force political parties to reveal their private funders and regulate public funding.

In March, the National Assembly approved the political party funding bill and referred it to the National Council of Provinces (NCOP) for 
consideration.

Vincent Smith, then chairperson of the National Assembly's now dissolved ad hoc committee on the funding of political parties, said the bill was now with the NCOP, who will refer it to President Cyril Ramaphosa for assenting.
