Lagos - A Consultant nutritionist, Dr Folu Olatona, has urged pregnant women to always eat balanced diets that will help boost their immunity against malaria.

She told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Wednesday in Lagos that the intensity of malaria would be reduced on any person who has adequate access to proper nutrition.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

According to her, a variety of foods, particularly those rich in protein, such as meat, fish, eggs and beans make up a balanced diet.

She said that a pregnant woman whose immunity is strong, stands a lesser chance of infecting the foetus in her womb than her counterpart with low immunity.

“But when the mother has malaria, there is a high risk of giving birth to a low-birth-weight baby or a baby-born prematurely,” she said.  

The nutritionist advised nursing mothers to place their babies on exclusive breast feeding between zero and six months.

She said that complementary feeding – regular foods and breast milk – should be given to those between six months and 24 months.
