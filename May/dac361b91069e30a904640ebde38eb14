Durban - KwaZulu-Natal has made great strides in the fight against HIV/AIDS. This was revealed by MEC for Health, Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo, during the delivery of his budget speech to KZN Legislature on Wednesday. KZN health has the second largest budget in the province - R43bn - after education. 

Dhlomo noted that whilst the province carried the largest burden of HIV and related infections in SA, there has been a marked decline in the positivity rate. AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

Dhlomo said this was thanks to a number of initiatives set out by the department as well an aggressive campaign to get people to get tested. 

“We are able to report that we have succeeded in raising the community awareness about the importance of every citizen knowing his or her HIV status,” he said. 

Dhlomo said citizens heeding the call have resulted in the biggest HIV Testing Services (HTS) Programme in the country. 

“We have seen over 3.1 million people coming voluntarily for testing just in the 2016/17 financial year alone. We can proudly announce that KZN has gone a long way in turning the tide against the spread of HIV and AIDS. In 2015, we celebrated the milestone of having initiated over 1 million patients on Antiretroviral Treatment. That number has increased to 1.28 million to date,” he said. 

Dhlomo added that through their efforts, they believe that they are on track to reach their target of 90-90-90 by 2020.

“This entails 90 percent of people knowing their status, 90 percent of those who are HIV positive put on treatment and 90 percent of those on treatment, having achieved viral suppression,” Dhlomo said.
