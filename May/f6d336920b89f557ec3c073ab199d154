"The SAPS Search and Rescue team and local police detectives were called out to the scene. There were blood stains found on the bridge where it seems like the person was attacked before his body was dumped into the canal below," Mathios said. 

He added that police were investigating further. 

Meanwhile, police have condemned two fatal attacks in Pietermaritzburg and Ulundi at the weekend. 

Police spokesperson, Captain Nqobile Gwala, said both dockets have been assigned to the Political Violence Task Team that will investigate further. 

She said on Saturday night, a 35-year-old man was driving along the R66 King Dinuzulu Highway when his car was blocked by unknown men who opened fire on him. 

"He sustained multiple gunshot wounds and was declared dead at the scene. The victim was identified as Sibuyiselo Dlamini. In another incident last night at in the Pata area in Pietermaritzburg, a 45-year-old man was driving his vehicle turning into his driveway when he was ambushed by unknown suspects who fired several shots at him. He sustained multiple injuries and was rushed to hospital where he later succumbed to his injuries. He was identified as Musawenkosi Mchunu," she said. 

Police are appealing to the community to remain calm and assist them in their investigation.
