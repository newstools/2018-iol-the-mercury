Durban - EThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede has called for calm in Chatsworth and Shallcross following unrest sparked by the death of 9-year-old Sadia Sikhraj during a botched hijacking.

Addressing the city’s executive committee, Gumede said the child’s death is a sign that extraordinary steps are required from law-enforcement agencies.

 “We hope the police will arrest the killers of our little girl, Sadia Sukhraj. We call for stability in Chatsworth and Shallcross,” she said.

The mayor then urged Exco members and officials to observe a moment of silence in the memory of Sadia.

Gumede also condemned political killings and urged residents to work together with police to fight crime.

She also welcomed the recent appointment of Lieutenant General Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi as the acting provincial police commissioner.

“We are of the view that this appointment of Lieutenant-General Mkhwanazi is much required in the province, he will bring new strategies and tactics to deal with crime. He has a vast experience in operational policing.”
