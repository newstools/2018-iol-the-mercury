Durban - A security guard was arrested following a shooting at a taxi rank opposite the RK Khan Hospital in Chatsworth, Durban south, on Thursday morning. 

It is alleged that the 30-year old guard shot a taxi driver, aged 40, in the leg during an argument. AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

Police spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbhele, said the driver was taken to hospital for medical attention. 

“Another person was assaulted during this altercation and is also receiving treatment.  Approximately 60 taxis from St Wendolins Taxi Association came to the scene and were protesting.  The rubber bullets were fired to disperse the unruly crowd,” she said. 

Mbhele said Chatsworth police, Public Order Police and Metro Police were monitoring the situation. 

Earlier in the day, protesters burnt tyres and put stones on the road, blocking it off to traffic. 

The shooting and subsequent shooting is believed to stem from ongoing route disputes between rival taxis. Last week photographs surfaced in WhatsApp groups showing scores of taxis blocking off roads in Chatsworth.
