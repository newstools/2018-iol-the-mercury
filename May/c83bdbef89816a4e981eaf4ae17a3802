“The passenger was met by Customs officials whilst the luggage was secured. The passenger did not deny his luggage and a search was conducted. The search revealed two packages wrapped in foil containing a powder suspected to be cocaine were concealed in false compartment of his suitcase. The false compartment was additional to the original make up of the suitcase. This was  professionally done to secure the narcotics but was clearly visible on the image analysis after scanning,” Mogale said. 

The man was arrested and will appear in the Kempton Park Magistrates court soon on charges of possession of illegal drugs.  

Mogale said this multi-disciplinary interventions will continue and the team is commended on their commitment to fighting crime.

Earlier this month, SARS Customs revealed that they had recovered 108kg of drugs which were hidden in boxes and declared as ‘calcium carbonate’.

Officials inspected the boxes in the cargo section at ORTIA after they arrived from Kenya on Tuesday. They discovered a white powdery substance and a brown sand-like substance, which they sent to a private laboratory for testing. The results came back positive for the drug ketamine (the white powdery substance) and Acetylanthranil, a base ingredient for Methaqualone (mandrax). The case has been handed over to the Hawks for further investigation.

In another incident, a truck leaving Lesotho was stopped at Ficksburg border post in the Free State and searched after the driver acted suspiciously. Customs officials then discovered 207 bags filled with cannabis weighing over 6 000kg. The total value of the cannabis is over R 9million. The driver was taken into police custody.
