The SAPS is clamping down on corruption among its senior members with lifestyle audits being conducted.
National Police Commissioner Lieutenant-General. Khehla Sitole said the vetting of officers would help to root out corruption in the police.

Police Minister Bheki Cele on Wednesday also told the Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) that he would not deny there was corruption in the police.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

He said they wanted to get to the bottom of corruption and remove corrupt elements.

Cele said the fact that last month alone they arrested 17 members of the police for corruption pointed to the seriousness of the problem.

“I cannot sit here and deny there is (a) problem. There is certainly a problem,” said Cele, adding that they hoped to clean up the system.

He said corruption also extended to other departments in government, and they were very concerned about this.

Recently, a sting operation led to the arrest of officials from Correctional Services and Home Affairs involved in serious corruption.

Sitole said they were busy with the lifestyle audits to find police officers involved in 
corruption. 

Police must not live beyond their means and people must explain their wealth, he said.

He said when President Cyril Ramaphosa announced the lifestyle audits of top government officials, the police were on top of the list. The head of the Independent ­Police Investigative Directorate, Robert McBride, told the portfolio committee on police last week that many senior officials were being investigated on corruption allegations. However, he warned that each time they tried to investigate the officials, the police would try to thwart their efforts.

Yesterday, McBride asked for co-operation from Sitole on their investigations into former head of crime intelligence Richard Mdluli.

Sitole said he would ask Cele to convene a meeting with McBride to address the matter.
