He had been dropping off his 7-month-old son before driving Sadia to school when hijackers struck, taking Sadia in the car with them. She was shot in the abdomen and later died in hospital.

Police said they are still investigating the shooting and would not confirm who had shot at whom. 

The incident opened up painful wounds for the Sukhraj family as Shailendra’s brother, Nivash, was shot dead 16 years ago, aged 18. 

“The birth of Sadia undoubtedly filled the void and brought healing to the family,” said relative Rajesh Neerachand at the funeral at the Christian Revival Centre in Chatsworth. 

The white hearse which brought Sadia’s small white casket to the church was led by a bagpipe player. 

Once inside, the casket was opened for mourners to view and say goodbye to Sadia who lay in a pink dress and tiara. 

Teachers from her school, Everest Primary, paid tribute to the star pupil with yellow roses. 

Commenting on the collective call for action in the aftermath of Sadia’s death, her principal, Anesh Singh, said: “If it took her to unite the community she had done her purpose and she is back with her maker.”

Among those who attended the funeral were DA national and provincial leaders Mmusi Maimane and Zwakele Mncwango and representatives of other political parties. 

Ravi Pillay, MEC for Public Works and Human Settlements, delivered a message of condolence on behalf of the provincial government. He said he had spoken to Community Safety and Liaison MEC Mxolisi Kaunda as well as Police Minister Bheki Cele. 

“They will be here to pay their respects but to also visit the police station to ensure that the investigation and preparation for court is thorough and diligent.”

He was referring to the court appearance of one hijacker who was apprehended by an off-duty police officer and arrested. One died on the scene, while a third fled. 

“We will also require a report on the protest and police action which took place last night,” said Pillay. 

Meanwhile, just as Sadia’s funeral ended, bail was set at R1000 each for the 20 people arrested for public violence during a picket outside the Chatsworth police station on Monday night. An appeal was made on social media for contributions for bail for those who could not afford it.

One of those who was released on bail denied that there had been public violence during the protest. 

“Firing of tear gas and stun grenades was totally uncalled for. I never lifted a hand, I never threw a stone, just voiced - vociferously - that we get more police protection, but the policemen in front of us took it personally,” he said. 

A night vigil was also held outside the Chatsworth Magistrate’s Court where candles were lit, with residents demanding justice for Sadia.

The Sukhrajs’ relative, Pastor Cyril Pillay, called for calm and for the community to unite. He said while the family appreciated the support, the chaos outside the police station broke his heart. “Crime is our enemy, not the police or the communities where the perpetrators come from,” he said.
