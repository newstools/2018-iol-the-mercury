By the time the neighbours entered the house, they found Steve in the kitchen, bleeding profusely, with his hands and legs tied with a telephone cable. He was unable to move.

His wife, who also had her hands and legs tied, was later discovered in one of the bedrooms with a pillow on top of her head. She had been suffocated, police said.
