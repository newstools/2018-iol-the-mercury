Rescue Care spokesperson, Garrith Jamieson, said when emergency teams arrived at the scene, they found two cars obstructing the roadway. 

"On assessment it was found that one person believed to be the driver of Toyota had sustained major injuries, there was nothing paramedics could do for him and he was declared deceased at the scene. Two other occupants were treated on scene by paramedics before being transported to various Durban hospitals for the further care that they required," he said. 

Earlier in the day, two people were injured in a truck and car collided at the intersection of Umbilo and Sarnia roads.
