The mother of three said her passion for running was discovered four years ago when she started running to get in shape. She fell in love with the sport and now it runs in her veins and is her addiction.
She said there were clear benefits of taking on a sport to help cope with the stresses of life. 
“Nursing does have an impact on your life. Once you enter the hospital, you leave everything behind and focus on your work. It’s actually not work
more like a calling. You focus on helping others. Sometimes you get stressed when you hear sad news like when you lose a patient, you can’t help these things from happening. It has impacted my life and changed the way I use to think before. As a nurse you are always nursing, where ever you are. If I’m tired or really stressful of what happened at work, painful circumstances with my patients, I take my running shoes, I do 10kms or 20kms to help relieve the stressful impact," she said. 
Hospital manager, Ahmed Docrat, said they were proud of Ncengeni. 
She’s a true ambassador of a working mom, and a nurse. We support her fully and wish her well on her first Comrades Marathon," he said.
