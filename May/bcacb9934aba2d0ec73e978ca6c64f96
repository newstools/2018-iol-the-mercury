The National Treasury’s ­report into a probe of the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa’s (Prasa) contracts worth more than R10million will be reviewed after the rail operator disputed its findings.
This emerged in a written reply from Transport Minister Blade Nzimande to a parliamentary question by the DA’s Manny de Freitas.

De Freitas had enquired about progress made into the Prasa contracts and money ­recovered in each case since July last year. He had also wanted know the progress made with investigations into those contracts that were below R10m, as well as any money recovered.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

His questions arose from the report of former public protector Thuli Madonsela, who investigated 38 allegations against Prasa and ordered a probe into R3.5 billion that was paid out to service providers.

As part of remedial action, Madonsela had ordered the National Treasury to probe all contracts worth more than R10m.

Last year, Prasa told Parliament that the National Treasury had investigated more than 100 contracts at a cost of R25m, as opposed to the R148m charged by Werksmans Attorneys for two contracts at the rail operator.

In his written response, Nzimande said the National Treasury had submitted a report on the outcome of their investigation into contracts above R10m to the interim board of Prasa for action.

“The Treasury report was scrutinised by Prasa, and Prasa has responded to the National Treasury indicating that some of the findings were inaccurate and needed to be ­reviewed.

“The National Treasury has therefore undertaken a process to reappoint the relevant service providers to review the disputed findings,” Nzimande said.

He added that once the service providers were appointed, a review would take place and the findings would be finalised.

Nzimande said no money had been recovered by Prasa in connection with the awarding of tenders above R10m.
