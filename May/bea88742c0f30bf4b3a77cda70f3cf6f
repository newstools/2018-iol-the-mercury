Three mayoral bodyguards, who were charged with the unlawful possession of firearms, have been let off the hook.
The charges against the men were withdrawn in the Durban Magistrate’s Court Thursday. 

Silence Jabulani Mkwakwa, 39, Lucas Siduduzo Mthembu, 40, and Khayelihle Mzila, 29, who guard Mandeni mayor Siphesihle Zulu, were arrested for the unlawful ­possession of firearms in ­September last year. ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

When they appeared on Thursday, the court heard that the State had decided to withdraw charges. 

The reasons for the withdrawal were not discussed in court.

Zulu was travelling with them in Mount Edgecombe when they were pulled off the road by the Hawks, and the ­bodyguards were arrested. 

After their first court appearance, they were released on warning. 

The firearms had been sent for ballistic testing to determine if they had been used in the commission of any crime. 

The Hawks had said four pistols, one rifle and live rounds of ammunition were seized.

At a press conference shortly after the incident, Zulu confirmed that one of the firearms was an AK47, however, according to court documents, the charges related to the possession of three 9mm pistols without “holding a licence, permit or authorisation”.
