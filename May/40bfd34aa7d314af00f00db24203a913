Durban - Drivers are once again reminded to physically check that their cars are locked before walking off. The reminder comes after a man was caught on CCTV camera, stealing from a car, despite the owner have activated the car lock. 

In the 1m 22sec video, a man drives into a parking space in a busy city centre. He is seen getting out of his car and locking the car via the remote. However, what the driver did not see, was another lurking behind the car who managed to open the back door and retrieve goods from the back seat. 
The footage shows the man taking items from the car. A few seconds later, he is seen holding boxes and he walks away from the car.

Fidelity ADT’s district manager in KwaZulu-Natal, Ivan Govender, said when leaving their cars, drivers should physically check and ensure that their cars are locked.

The extra few seconds it takes to make sure the car is properly locked and secured are worth it,” Govender said. 

He said criminals depend on their targets being distracted. 

“It is when people are not paying attention when they become easy targets for would-be thieves. The best option is therefore to be on the lookout for anyone following you or someone loitering at your car in the parking area. Trust your instincts,” he said.
