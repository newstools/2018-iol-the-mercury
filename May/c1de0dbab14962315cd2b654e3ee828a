The Department of Education has further slashed its infrastructure budget, raising fears that much-needed schools will not be built this financial year.
The Mercury understands the infrastructure budget will be cut by R228million this ­financial year.

While tabling his budget last week, Education MEC Mthandeni Dlungwane said: “It is unfortunate the infrastructure allocation continues to decline.”AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

He said that despite the decline, the department was making substantial investments in a number of schools. 

“When infrastructure challenges are identified, urgent interventions are immediately conducted,” he said.

He added that the department was dealing with overcrowding at schools. In Pongola, in northern KZN, Dingukwazi High School, which was overcrowded, was being transformed into a state-of-the-art school.

He said there were also plans to build an agricultural school in the Ncwadi area, in the Midlands.

The chairperson of the ­finance portfolio committee, Sipho Nkosi, said the department needed to get creative to deal with the budget cuts.

“The department will need to slow down on building new schools. They will need to focus on moving the pupils in small schools, where there are one or two teachers, to other schools,” he said. 

DA MPL and its spokesperson on education, Rishigen Viranna, said the cuts were a huge setback for communities that desperately need schools.

Viranna said there were many schools that still needed to be built, in areas like Durban and Pietermaritzburg, due to the movement of people from rural areas to cities.
