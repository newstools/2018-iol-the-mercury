Sadia Sukhraj was seated inside her father's Hyundai iX35 when it was hijacked by three men. Sadia's father, Shailendra, had just dropped off Sadia's younger brother at a relative's home. 
According to provincial police spokesperson, Captain Nqobile Gwala, less than 300m aware, the hijackers crashed the SUV into the side of a truck. Sadia was shot in the abdomen. She died a short while later in hospital. 

Earlier on Tuesday morning, a crowd gathered at the Chatsworth Magistrates Court to demand the release of residents arrested during a protest on Monday night. Following word of Sadia's death, residents gathered outside the Chatsworth police station. Just after 3pm, tensions flared as residents began to burn tyres on the road outside the police station.
