Durban - The grief-stricken father of slain Mangosuthu University of Technology student, Zolile Khumalo, says she is the seventh of his children to pass away.
Speaking before Zolile’s memorial service at the university’s Dr Pixley Ka Seme Hall on Thursday, Comfort Khumalo said losing Zolile was especially difficult for the family as she was the last born and was the only one to be killed, the others had fallen ill.

His only surviving daughter, Sena Khumalo, was by his side at the memorial, with other family members there to offer support. Zolile’s mother remained home at Eshowe to receive mourners. AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

 



During the memorial, Bishop Vusi Dube prayed for the family that the deaths would cease. 

He also warned students not to date people they didn’t know. He called the alleged killer, Thabani Mzolo, an “animal” for robbing Zolile’s parents of another child.

 



Throughout the service, 21 students stood in a guard of honour at the front of the hall.

They were called forward to stand holding candles, not just in memory of Zolile, but also as a pledge against abuse of women. 

Her friend, Nosihle Mkhwanazi, described her as a happy person, who loved to sing and dance. “She would even wake us up singing “guerillas don’t sleep,” and just wanted to have fun and laugh.”

 



Passing his condolences to the family, MUT Vice-Chancellor Dr Enoch Malaza said 
the university would be assisting with funeral costs on Saturday. 

 



He also offered the students counselling should they need it. 

Twenty-one-year-old Mangosuthu University of Technology (MUT) student Khumalo was gunned down, allegedly  by her jilted boyfriend, at her Lonsdale residence last week. 

She was in her  first-year of studying quantity surveying.
