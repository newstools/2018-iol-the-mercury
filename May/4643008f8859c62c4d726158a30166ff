Cape Town - The Democratic Alliance announced on Tuesday that Patricia de Lille has ceased to be a member of the party, thereby ending her seven-year rule as mayor of Cape Town.

Natasha Mazzone, the deputy chairwoman of the DA's federal council, told a media briefing the "cessation of her membership" was based on the fact that De Lille breached the party's constitution by declaring her readiness to resign on a radio talk show.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

De Lille's assertion that she was "ready to walk away" sealed her fate, she said.

James Selfe, the chairman of the federal executive, confirmed that deputy mayor Ian Neilson will serve as acting mayor.

Selfe conceded that he did not think the decision to terminate De Lille's membership of the party would end a bruising battle between her and the party, which has repeatedly landed up in the Cape Town High Court.

"I would like to think that the saga ends today, but somehow I doubt it."
