Durban - The South African Network of People who Use Drugs (SANPUD), held a peaceful protest on Tuesday morning against the suspension of the distribution of sterile needles and syringes to drug users in Durban by eThekweni Municipality's Environmental health department.

The protesters marched from The KwaZulu Natal Society of the Arts to the TB/HIV Care Association in Umbilo.
The Needle Syringe Programme (NSP), which is an initiative of the TB/HIV Care Association was suspended on May 8 after a notice letter was sent to the association by eThekweni Municipality.

TB/HIV Care project coordinator, Kalvanya Padayachee said that trade by-laws were cited for the suspension of the programme and the association was asked to complete a schedule trade application form which was submitted last week.

NSP has been running since 2015 and serviced over 1200 people with a recorded return rate of roughly 80% of needles and syringes that are distributed. 

"We were served with a notice saying that we violated the city's by-laws because we haven't completed, what they call, a schedule trade application form to trade as an organisation or someone who is generating medical waste," said Padayachee.

Professor Monique Marks, head of Urban Future Center at Durban University of Technology(DUT) explained that the NSP program was thrown into the spotlight after hundreds of needles and syringes washed up on a Durban beach earlier this year.

"There was an assumption that the needles and syringes that were found on the beach front came from TB/HIV Care. However, those needles are generic, they could be from the hospital, they could be from other drug users that purchase them at the pharmacy," she said. 
"This project was blamed because it's really the only project that offers this service. We are not saying that none of the needles are ours. It is possible that some of them were," Marks said.

Malusi Mbatha, former user and current chairperson of SANPUD explained that the Step up mobile unit that facilitates NSP program goes out into the streets to look for the syringes and needles.
"Whenever we do cleanups, we take each and every needle. We take other people's needles, not just our own because if there are needles lying around and there is a disease in that needle others will contract that disease." said Mbatha.

A memorandum and signed petition was delivered to the mayor's office asking for the reinstatement of the project.
