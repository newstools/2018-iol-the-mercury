Former member of Parliament Dr Makhosi Khoza has joined the Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (OUTA), to head up its new local government programme, the organisation announced on Friday.

“Today, I am pleased to announce that Dr Makhosi Khoza has been appointed as OUTA’s Executive Director and Head of OUTA’s Local Government Programme, effective 1 June 2018,” said Wayne Duvenage, OUTA’s CEO. ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

Duvenage said Dr Khoza has stood out as an ardent champion and fighter of corruption and maladministration within Government.  

"At the risk of her own safety, Dr Khoza has become an icon for truth, justice and good governance within Government. She is bold, courageous and comes with a history and experience that suits this role within OUTA.”

Dr Khoza said that she is excited about getting involved in a credible and apolitical platform. 

“It just makes more sense to make a difference in South Africa by empowering citizens on grassroots level and addressing maladministration and corruption in municipalities, free from politics. The intention here is to make a significant impact through civil society and not making noises in Parliament.”

Both Duvenage and Khoza expressed the importance of empowered and organised civil society to hold government to account. 

“It doesn't matter which party is in power, civil society must ensure civil servants are held accountable for the efficient, economic and effective use of resources by municipalities, free from the abuse of authority,” said Duvenage.

Khoza, an outspoken former ANC Member of Parliament announced her retirement from politics last month, barely four months after the formation and launch of ADeC.
