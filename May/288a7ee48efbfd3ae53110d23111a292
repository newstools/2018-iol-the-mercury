Durban - Almost 40 cases of corruption where R9 million of state funds were squandered, have been reported to police.

The department said in a statement on Wednesday, that the 38 cases all stem from the past financial year. 

There were 42 more cases of corruption and maladministration currently being investigated. 

MEC Themba Mthembu said his department had zero tolerance on fraud, maladministration and corruption. 
“Such activities can no longer continue to be the culture of this department. From now on, committing fraud and corruption will be taboo and I will not hesitate to take action,” he said.

Mthembu is expected to detail these cases and elaborate on other issues he touched on in his recent budget policy speech at a breakfast on Thursday morning. 

The contentious issue of land is expected to also be on the table. 

In his statement, Mthembu said; “government must take a concomitant action against land grabs that are currently gripping the province.”

He will also outline the Provincial Agricultural Masterplan, which is a strategy to significantly drive the agronomy of the province and radically alleviate the triple threats, which are poverty, unemployment and inequality.
