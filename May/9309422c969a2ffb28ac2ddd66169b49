According to Police spokesperson, Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane, Mazeka had left his home in Marianhill to fetch Mnguni. Family told police that Mnguni would have to walk through a dense forest on the way home from work and for this reason, Mazeka would meet her at work and walk her home. 

“On that day, it is alleged that Langelihle left their room and was on his way to meet with his girlfriend. He had left his cellphone at home. Both of them never returned. Langelihle is originally from Impendle and Nozipho is from Greytown,” Zwane said.

He said although the families have identified the remains by the clothing worn by the deceased, police are awaiting results from DNA tests.
