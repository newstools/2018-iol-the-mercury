She had fled to her parents' home, from her husband Sipho, after an altercation on Saturday night.  

The murder of Dlamini - who was a nurse at Edendale Hospital - was condemned by health MEC Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo as “barbaric” and “cruel.”

According to the Department of Health, Dlamini had turned up for work on Sunday despite being battered and bruised after allegedly being assaulted by her husband on Saturday night.

A colleague noticed she was not well and advised her to see a doctor.

After her appointment, she retreated to the safety of her parent’s home. However, her husband followed her there and found her sitting with her parents.

He demanded she come home with him but she refused. Fearing more blows, she ran into one of the bedrooms and locked herself inside. Her husband followed her, shot off the lock and kicked down the door before shooting her as her panicked parents and brother looked on in horror.

He fled the scene. However, Mbhele said his body was later found in Richmond. He had a gunshot wound to the chin.

The couple had two boys aged 8 and 11-years.

Dlamini's death once again shines the spotlight on the number of women, killed at the hands of their partners.
