OPINION: I write to express my concern over the issue of abuse of power and corruption in government. Since our 24 years of democracy there has been outright and open corruption by government officials who have been placed to manage the affairs and develop this country economically, educationally, politically and otherwise.

We have seen the privilege given to some individuals to manage the affairs of this country being misused, abused and dynasties created, some have enriched themselves and their cronies and, in turn, the very people who have elected them to serve have been neglected.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

We must agree that it is unfair for educated individuals with the right qualification deserving jobs but not getting them due to nepotism being displayed.

With our Health Department under scrutiny every now and again we must anticipate more is yet to come.

We must rapidly come up with solutions to our problems such as crime, unemployment, poverty, as they are all vital in the development of our country and our position in the international arena.

We must stop government officials in their destiny to becoming rich through government.

We need to carefully seek to place the right individuals with the right mindset and qualifications to run this country in the direction that is beneficial to every South African.
