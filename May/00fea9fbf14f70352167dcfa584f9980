Later, he posted about the incident on his Facebook page saying, "konke kwaphenduka umlando ukube benginamandla bengzomvusa silungise amaphutha ngomlomo ...kodwa mnj kuphi laa ngba usehambe wangshiya ngingasashongo ukt ngyamxolela" (All is history now. If I had the power I was going to make her rise - from the dead - so that we can talk about the mistakes... but now she is gone before I could even tell her that I forgive her). 

The murder has been condemned by various political parties, including the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) and Democratic Alliance (DA). 

MUT Chancellor and International Relations and Cooperation Minister, Lindiwe Sisulu, also expressed her shock at the murder. 

"I feel deep sympathy for her parents, family and friends, it is painful and very sad. We must do more to protect women from being murdered by partners or former partners. We trust that the judicial system will take necessary steps and send a clear message to perpetrators that South Africans are tired of such senseless killings will not tolerate them,” Sisulu said.

The accused, a former MUT student, is due to appear in the Durban Magistrate's Court on Thursday.
