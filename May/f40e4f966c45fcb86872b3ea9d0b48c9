Perfecting blends with only the finest quality ingredients is not the only thing Barn 
Owl management bring to the table.

A priority for this hot and happening beverage company is their commitment to coffee conservation.

“As a way to fight the waste in the take-away coffee industry, our cups and lids are 100% biodegradable and our straws are upcycled reeds,” Solomon said.

This year’s Royal Show takes place from May25 to June3, at the Royal Agricultural Showgrounds in Pieter­maritzburg.

Apart from the animal shows and food and drink on offer, there will also be lots of entertainment, including music concerts, a zipline and a funfair.
