"Whilst paramedics were trying to free the woman, she went into cardiac arrest. Despite resuscitation efforts, the woman died at the scene,"  he said. 

Meanwhile, motorists are urged to drive carefully as heavy rains are expected to batter the KZN east coast this week. This is according to the South African Weather Services (SAWS) who issued an alert on Monday. There were also reports of snow in the Eastern Cape. Heavy rains could lead to localised flooding in some parts of the province.

SAWS advised residents to take precautionary measures when encountering flooding.

If possible stay indoors and off the roads, avoid crossing rivers and swollen streams where water is above your ankles. If trapped in a flooding situation whilst in a vehicle, rather abandon it and climb to higher ground. In buildings, move valuables to a safe place above the expected flood level. Switch off electricity at the supply point to the building. In rural areas protect/relocate animals to a safe place on higher ground. Abandon your home immediately if evacuation is recommended by duly authorised officials, before access is cut off by flood water. Never drive on a road covered or obscured by water. You do not know how deep it is or if the road has been washed away. If the vehicle stalls, leave it immediately and seek higher ground. Be especially cautious at night when it is difficult to identify flood hazards.
