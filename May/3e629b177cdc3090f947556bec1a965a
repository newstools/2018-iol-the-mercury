Durban - The Mangosuthu University of Technology (MUT) is to install metal detectors at all its off-campus residences.
This comes in the wake of the murder of Zolile Khumalo, who was gunned down at the Lonsdale student residence in the Durban CBD last week. 

The 21-year-old first-year quantity surveying student was shot dead, allegedly by a former student and her ex-boyfriend, Thabani Mzolo, 23. AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

He is due to apply for bail in the Durban Magistrate’s Court on Thursday. 

Dr Enoch Malaza, who was appointed vice-chancellor and principal of the institution on the same day Khumalo was shot, announced they had instructed the landlords at their outsourced residences to install metal detectors as a matter of urgency. 

Although it was initially reported that Mzolo was let into the residence by another student, MUT is conducting an internal investigation into how he gained entry. 

“MUT is committed to
ensuring a safe and secure environment for our students at all our residences, and we are determined to strengthen our oversight responsibility to
ensure landlords comply,” said Malaza. 

Lonsdale houses the most students of all the university’s 19  external residences - 661 of 5 977. It also has six security guards during the day and six at night, while other residen­ces have a maximum of three. 

In the wake of Khumalo’s murder, the university has brought in internal auditors to do an assessment of security at all residences. But MUT SRC president Sandile Dlamini said the university was hiding behind landlords.

Welcoming the installation of metal detectors as a positive development, he said landlords would maximise profits by hiring the cheapest security company or taking people off the street and putting them in uniform and calling them
security in order to comply with the university contract. 

“Those are the people they are entrusting with young lives,” said Dlamini.
