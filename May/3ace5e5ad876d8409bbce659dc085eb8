Durban - The Department of Higher Education believes there should be a tightening of ­access controls across all universities.
This statement, made by the chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Higher ­Education and Training, Connie September, comes days after a student was gunned down, allegedly by her ex-boyfriend, at a residence in Durban.

September said universities needed to tighten residential security as the new-found freedom among many students could unintentionally expose them to abuse.

“The committee sends its deepest condolences to the family of the deceased. We are extremely shocked and saddened that this tragedy happened on one of our campuses. Zolile Khumalo did not deserve to die like this,” she said.

September said they were trying to find out who gave the man access to the residence.

She called on MUT to investigate the incident thoroughly.

“If it is found that the former student had worked with current students in accessing the residences, those students should be identified and disciplined accordingly,” she said. 

“A situation where campuses become places of torment should not be allowed.” 

It is alleged that Khumalo’s ex-boyfriend, Thabani Mzolo, gained entry to the Lonsdale residence in Durban, where he is believed to have shot Khumalo. Mzolo has since appeared in court on a charge of murder and the possession of an illegal firearm. 

He was remanded and is due back in court this week to apply for bail.
