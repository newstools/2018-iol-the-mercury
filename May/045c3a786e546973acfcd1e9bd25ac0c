NSRI spokesperson, Craig Lambinon, said the NSRI Richards Bay duty crew was activated by the Transnet National Ports Authority (TNPA) to rendezvous with the motor vessel Medi Hong Kong, sailing from United Arab Emirates, to evacuate the patient. 
"The sea rescue craft Spirit of Round Table II was launched accompanied by a KZN government health EMS rescue paramedic and we rendezvoused with the ship 25 nautical miles off-shore. The EMS rescue paramedic was taken onboard the ship to medically assess and the patient, in a stable condition, was transferred onto our sea rescue craft and brought to our sea rescue station and he has been transported to hospital by an EMS ambulance," he said. 
Lambinon said they were first alerted on Wednesday. He said the Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre and a government health EMS duty doctor had monitored the patient's medical condition pending a patient evacuation while the ship was deep sea.
"On approaching Richards Bay in the early hours of Saturday morning, the patient's evacuation was authorised and TNPA activated our NSRI Richards Bay duty crew," he said. 
The sailor was rushed to a hospital nearby.
