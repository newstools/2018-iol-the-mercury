Durban - For Domingo Texiero - a drug addict and one of the protesters who marched earlier this week for the reinstatement of the TB/HIV Care Association's Needle Support Program (NSP) - sharing a needle with another addict could cost him his life.

Before NSP was suspended on May 8 by eThekweni Municipality, the programme serviced over 1200 drug users with syringes and provided a means to dispose of the used hazardous needles.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

"Some of us when we on the streets, we have to either buy needles or the cops confiscate the ones we have. So if we don't have money for a needle, we have to share them and if you share with someone who has hepatitis C or HIV you will be contracting that disease," said Texiero.

Texiero further explained that the program also made agreements with the recipients of the syringes to clean up the streets of all hazardous materials. 

"We have a place where we can safely discard them. The moment they took away our safely discarded position, we are throwing needles on the ground again. The municipality says that they want to clean it up but how they gonna clean it up when they don't give us a place to throw away the needles safely," Texiero said.

TB/HIV Care project coordinator, Kalvanya Padayachee said that trade by-laws were cited for the suspension of the programme and the association was asked to complete a schedule trade application form which was submitted last week.

In addition to the NSP programme, TB/HIV Care also assists users with medical, mental and emotional support.
"They help us with medicine, they give us food sometimes. If you go to them and tell them and say, ‘I’m tired of this life’ they contact your family, they try to get your family to regroup with you."

A memorandum and signed petition was delivered to the mayor's office on Tuesday asking for the reinstatement of the project.

'If I’m in a rush to use, I have to share a needle with somebody and until I am clean I want to be safe from HIV and other diseases. I don’t want my mistake to cost me my life. I can still get clean from drugs. They help me stay safe from HIV," said Texiero.
