The ‘Cobra’ actress has caused a stir on social media with her pregnancy announcement, with many fans calling her an “inspiration” for having another child later in her life.Responding to one fan, Brigitte wrote: "Nobody has the rights to lead your own decision unless you allow them to do so. You’re the only one in charge of yourself and your own happiness. Best of luck!"Brigitte has been married to Mattia since 2006, but was previously wed to Kasper for a year from 1983 to 1984, before she enjoyed a two-year marriage to Sylvester Stallone from 1985 to 1987, followed by Sebastian Copeland in 1990 until 1992, and then Raoul from 1993 to 2005.Bang Showbiz
