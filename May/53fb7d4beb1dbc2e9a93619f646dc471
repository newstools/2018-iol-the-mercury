Durban - A man died after the boat he was aboard capsized at the Kowie River Mouth at the weekend. The man, in his 60s, and a friend were exiting the harbour and about to go out to sea when their ski boat, Diligo, was hit by waves and capsized. 

National Sea Rescue Institute spokesperson, Craig Lambinon, said the NSRI Port Alfred duty crew was activated. AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

"The sea rescue craft Rescue 11 Alpha was launched and our sea rescue vehicle with NSRI rescue swimmers, Eastern Cape government health EMS and the police responded to East Beach. On arrival at the scene, they found that following the boat's capsizing, it was washed onto a sand bank in the surfline at East Beach," he said. 
Lambinon said one man, in his 50s, was found safe on the beach suffering minor injuries and his friend, the skipper of the boat, was missing in the surf after their boat had capsized in the three to four metre swells. 
He said during a search, the man's body was located in the shallow surf at East Beach and the body was recovered by our NSRI rescue swimmers and he has been declared deceased by paramedics.

The body of the man, who is from Johannesburg but now living in Port Alfred, was taken into the care of the SAPS Forensic Pathology Services and police have opened an inquest docket.
