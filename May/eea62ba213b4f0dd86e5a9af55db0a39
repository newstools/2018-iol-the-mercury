Durban - The Democratic Alliance(DA) in KwaZulu Natal announced Friday that party members will be visiting the family of Abbas Essop - one of the three men gruesomely attacked at a North Coast mosque in Ottawa on Thursday - to show support. 

Essop, 35, was critically wounded when three knife-wielding men stormed the Imam Hussain Mosque. Essop lost his life soon after the attack while the other two victims are in a critical condition.

"The Democratic Alliance in KwaZulu Natal sends heartfelt condolences to the family and friends of the victims of Thursday's horrific and senseless attack on the mosque," said KZN DA provincial leader, Zwakele Mncwango.

The party welcomed the joint intervention of the South African Police Service and the Hawks in investigating this "barbaric" attack that also left some parts of the Mosque torched.

"We are calling on these law enforcement agencies to investigate whether this was an act of crime or a terror attack. We are concerned by the failure of our Intelligence to pick up these atrocious crimes before they occur.  The DA condemns any act or attack that seeks to divide people according to their race and religion," Mncwango said.

It has been alleged three of the suspects stormed the mosque, in Old Main Road, ­Ottawa, repeatedly stabbing the victims before slitting their throats. The fourth suspect was in the getaway vehicle, a white Hyundai Getz.

"South Africa belongs to everyone regardless of their religion. We stand with the family and the Muslim community and we are calling for calm as investigations continue," said Mncwango.
