Police are also asking residents to come forward if they are able to identify those responsible for the riots at Moses Mabhida last month. 

Brigadier Jay Naicker said many of those who were injured left after receiving medical attention and did not leave their contact details behind with police.

“We are also appealing to witnesses to please come forward and provide police with information with regards to the perpetrators of the violence and destruction of property that was witnessed on that day,” he said. 

Naicker said an appeal is made to all members of the public who can assist the police in their investigations to urgently contact Capt Reddy 082 458 5630 or Detective Warrant Officer Mlungwana 082 662 7764. 

“All information will be treated with the strictest confidence,” he said.
