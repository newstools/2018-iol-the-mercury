The Estate Agency Affairs Board said on Wednesday, it was dealing with illegal estate agents as it undermined not only the rule of law but also the sector’s future and its credibility.
“We are dealing with people who have no regard for the rule of law and compliance with industry standards”, said the board’s acting chief executive Nikita Sigaba.

He said in the past financial year the board had prosecuted more than 120 estate agents who were not complying with the law or who were practising without a valid Fidelity Fund Certificate as required by the Estate Agency Affairs Board Act.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

“It is difficult to quantify the number of illegal practitioners since they are not registered. We rely on people and the industry to provide us with information,” said Sigaba.

Many estate agents have raised concerns about the negative impact of illegal estate agents on the sector and the ability of the board to deal with this problem, which Sigaba admittted if left unresolved would damage the industry.

“Where we come across these agents we assist them to comply while proceeding with disciplinary action against them. In addition, we are working with the SAPS by training the Commercial Crime Unit in understanding the act to enable the effective prosecution of  unregistered estate agents,” he said.
