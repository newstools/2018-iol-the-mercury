Durban - Durban residents and holidaymakers need not worry about any unusual shark ­activity along the city’s popular beach bathing areas.
KwaZulu-Natal Sharks Board head of operations, Mark Anderson-Reade, said the shark warning flags that could be seen posted on some beaches along the city’s Golden Mile were not a warning about high shark activity, but rather an indication that the shark nets had been removed to allow for sand dredging.

“Bathing is closed from Country Club to New Beach because of the sand pumping so that the dredgers can get in,” Anderson-Reade said. AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

He said the Sharks Board had placed the warning flags along various beaches as the city continued with dredging operations along the coastline over the past five weeks.

eThekwini Municipality spokesperson Mandla Nsele said the sand replenishment project that started earlier this month would replenish sand on various beach nodes along the central beachfront. 

He said shark nets had now been removed at Bay of Plenty and Suncoast Beach. 

“These beach nodes include North, Dairy south and north, Suncoast and possibly Country Club beach nodes,” Nsele said.

He said the project would be completed, weather permitting, on Saturday.

“The sand-pumping operations have been very successful and we believe that Durban beaches will provide visitors and locals with an enjoyable beach experience,” Nsele said.

Meanwhile, Anderson-
Reade said it was still early in the season to expect sardine activity.

“Of course rumours are flying and everyone is getting excited - but it is the normal hype prior to the run,” he said.
