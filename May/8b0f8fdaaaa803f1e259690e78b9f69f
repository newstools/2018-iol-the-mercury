Durban - Thousands of people have been flocking to KwaMachiÂ outside Harding, southern KZN, due to a suspected gold rush.

When the Mercury visited the small town on Wednesday, local hardware store owners said they seen a spike in sales of shovels, hammers, axes, hard hats and lights as people flocked to a site about 15km from the town where gold has allegedly been found.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

According to the SABC, the gold-digging started after road construction workers found a goldish stone in the village, which falls under the Umuziwabantu Local Municipality.

People who spoke to The Mercury said small pieces of rock were being sold at varying prices from about R50.

It is believed that people were injured during a rock fall at the site earlier this week leading to the site being fenced off.

However, when The Mercury visited the site yesterday, hundreds of people were still present but police instructed them to vacate the property.
