The ANC has come under attack from opposition MPs over the party’s attempts to shield Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba over a stalled immigration amendment bill, nine months after a Constitutional Court ruling mandated the change.
Gigaba, his dir­ector-general Mkuseli Apleni and the department’s top brass appeared before the Home ­Affairs portfolio committee.

The meeting was convened after the department took nearly nine months to comply with a Constitutional Court judgment which found a section of the law dealing with detention of illegal immigrants invalid.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

The court suspended the ­invalidity of the section and gave Parliament until June this year to make the necessary amendments.

Apleni told the MPs he had brought the matter to the attention of the committee in November 2017, after his suspension. However, the DA’s Haniff Hoosen said the issue was what the department had done to give effect to the ruling of the court immediately after the judgment.

“This judgment is regrettable in that we were operating for years, detaining people without trial, and the Constitutional Court had to make a ruling against the department.”

ANC MP Deborah Raphuti said the judgment showed the constitution was working.

“It protects whoever, irrespective of whether you are a foreign national or not. We should applaud our constitution, rather than pointing ­fingers,” Raphuti said.
