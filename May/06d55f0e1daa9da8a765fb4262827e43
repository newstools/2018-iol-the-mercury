Durban - A man and two teenagers were rescued after being trapped on the north bank of the Zinkwazi River, at the weekend. The teens, aged 14 and 15, were believed to be out swimming when they got into difficulty. The man then tried to help but all three ended up needing to be rescued. 

National Sea Rescue Institute spokesperson, Craig Lambinon, said ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

The NSRI Ballito duty crew were activated following requests for assistance made to both NSRI Durban and NSRI Richards Bay on Sunday. 

“The three were trapped near the river mouth which opened during Spring Tide, causing water flowing strongly through the river mouth into the sea.

“NSRI Ballito rescue swimmers responded to the scene towing our sea rescue craft Remax Rescuer,” he said. 

The three had been fishing when they were cut off by the Spring Tide.

NSRI Ballito station commander, Quentin Power, said it was not possible to reach the three from the north due to the rising Spring Tide. 

“We set up a rope system and I reached them managing to get across to the north bank in chest deep rapidly flowing water. We put them into life-jackets and the rope system was secured between the north and south banks. They were hooked onto the rope and we were able to bring all three of them safely across the river in relays secured to the rope system without incident. We also managed to recover their fishing gear,” Power said. 

The three were not injured during their ordeal.
