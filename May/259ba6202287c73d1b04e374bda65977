Durban - Police Minister Bheki Cele announced that former acting national police commissioner Nhlanhla Lucky Mkhwanazi has been appointed as the new acting KwaZulu-Natal police commissioner.
Mkhwanazi takes over from the acting pprovincial commissioner Major-General Bheki Langa who was appointed after the suspension of provincial police commissioner Lieutenant-General Mmamonnye Ngobeni. 

Ngobeni had been placed on suspension pending an inquiry into her fitness to hold office.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

The inquiry was related to allegations of misconduct related to Ngobeni’s relationship with Durban businessman Thoshan Panday, who apparently paid for a lavish birthday party for her husband Lucas Ngobeni.

However Ngobeni has maintained that she paid Panday’s company Gold Coast Trading cc to arrange the party and Panday denied any wrongdoing.

Yesterday, Cele explained that a permanent provincial commissioner could only be appointed once the Ngobeni matter had been settled.

“Until the matter of the suspension of Lieutenant-General Ngobeni is finalised, we cannot appoint anyone else, that is why he comes in an acting capacity,” Cele said. 

Ngobeni, earlier this year lost an appeal to the Supreme Court of Appeal regarding her suspension, the ruling paves the way for the inquiry to be instituted against her.

Mkhwanazi was appointed by then president Jacob Zuma to replace then suspended national commissioner Cele pending the outcome of an investigation into “unlawful” police lease agreements. He acted as national commissioner for nine months between 2011 and 2012 before the permanent appointment of General Riah Phiyega.
