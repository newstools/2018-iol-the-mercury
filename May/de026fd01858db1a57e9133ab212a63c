The mother went to the police station to open a missing person's report. 

Police searched through the night for the kidnapped women, only to discover the 19-teen-year old at a second boyfriend's home in New Hanover

The woman was immediately arrested and a case of perjury was opened at the New Hanover police station.

The KwaZulu-Natal acting Provincial Commissioner, Major General Bheki Langa condemned the act and warned against reporting false cases.

“We cannot tolerate people who are opening false cases to satisfy their needs. A lot of manpower and physical resources were used after the case was opened. This arrest will serve as a wake up call to all those who open false cases that they will be brought before justice and pay for their wrongful deeds,” he said.

 

The woman is scheduled to appear in the New Hanover Magistrates’ Court on Monday.
