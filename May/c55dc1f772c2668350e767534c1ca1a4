Durban - Three men arrested in connection with violence that broke out at the Moses Mabhida stadium over a week ago have been given a stern warning not to set foot in any stadium in the country.
The three suspects, Siphosenkosi Memela, 35, Sibongiseni Khumalo, 29, and Khwezilomo Madiba, 35,  appeared in the Durban Magistrate’s Court on charges of public violence, pitch invasion and interfering with police work. 

They are alleged to have been part of the throngs of fans who ran amok after Kaizer Chiefs lost to Free State Stars in a Nedbank Cup semi-final at Moses Mabhida last week.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

Fans went on the rampage after the game, invading the pitch and damaging stadium infrastructure and broadcast equipment. The damage to the stadium was later estimated at R2.6 million.

The men were granted bail of R1000 each by Magistrate Mohamed Motala, who said the accused should understand  they were facing serious ­charges.

Prosecutor Calvin Govender earlier indicated that one of the accused had allegedly damaged broadcasting equipment, while another was seen assaulting a security guard. Motala warned that should the three not abide by the bail conditions, which include not setting foot in any stadium, bail would be revoked.

Lawyers representing the three men indicated that they intended to plead guilty to the charges.

All three, plus Phelelani Jojisa, who was arrested earlier on pitch invasion charges, are due back in court on May 25.
