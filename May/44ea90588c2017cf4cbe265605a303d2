Durban - 67 Blankets for Nelson Mandela Day is all about breaking records and this year is no exception. KnitWits are in the throes of attempting another  world record by crocheting a 27 Kilometre of scarves or #27KmScarf as it has become known as. It is an initiative linked to Nelson Mandela Day which aims to keep disadvantaged people warm in winter.

The record will take place at the impressive Nelson Mandela Capture Site in Howick, KwaZulu Natal, on July 29. However, the deadline for the anyone to finish the scarves they are currently crocheting is the June 25.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

According to founder of 67 Blankets, Carolyn Steyn, 27 kilometres is an extremely long scarf.
"We need as many hands on deck as possible,” she said.

Since the supernaturally long scarf is an attempt at breaking the Guinness World Record there are rules which come with the well-known brand. Each scarf must be 20cm x 150 to 200cm. It also needs to be crocheted rather than knitted and the hook size must be no bigger than 6.5mm. “KnitWits who have already knitted scarves that don’t fit the Guinness World Book criteria need not worry. It has not been in vain. These scarves will be used for our yearly #SSS (Secret Scarves SShhh),” Steyn said.  

The #27kmScarf event on July 29 kicks off at 10am at the Nelson Mandela Capture site on the R103 ( Howick / Tweedie off-ramp off the N3) 
Please bring your own picnic. There will be food at the Truth Café and some great local entertainment.
