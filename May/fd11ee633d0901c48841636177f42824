Durban - eThekwini Municipality, Zandile Gumede, has declined to comment on news that she is under investigation. 

It is believed that elite investigation unit, the Hawks, is investigating Gumede for fraud, corruption, facilitating money laundering and allegedly paying back people who assisted her in advancing her political ambitions. Hawks national spokesperson, Brigadier Hangwani Malaudzi, confirmed to media that Gumede had been placed under investigation. Two other councillors within the municipality are also implicated, however they have not been named. AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
When contacted for comment, Gumede said she was unaware of the investigation. 
She said she was looking into the matter. 

Meanwhile, Democratic Alliance leader in KwaZulu-Natal, Zwakele Mncwango, has welcomed news of the investigation.

He said the investigation was a sign that state institutions can still be trusted, by the public, to ensure that crime is stamped out. 

“In March, we met with Hawks head, General Jabulani Zikhali to discuss and hand over a dossier detailing allegations of corruption in the city. Today, we are  relieved by the fact that an investigation is underway and that the integrity of state institutions like the Hawks, is being reinstated,” he said. 

Mncwango added that the Hawks must follow the money in order to clear out corruption.

“The arrest of corrupt politicians will minimise political killings in the province as most are related to tender conflicts,” he said.
