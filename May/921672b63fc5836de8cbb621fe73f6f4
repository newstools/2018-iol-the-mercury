EDITOR'S VIEW - Rubbish was strewn about uMlazi in January as contracted collectors reacted angrily to council non-payment. Four months on, this health risk assailed the residents again - for the same reason.
The question to pose to the eThekwini municipality is: Why? When the first breakdown was remedied, it was not unreasonable to assume that steps had been put in place immediately to prevent a repeat.

Another strike by collectors since last Tuesday tells us this was not done. The stoppage 
was resolved yesterday, in the face of a threat by collectors that it would go on until they were notified of payment.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

This strike was more subdued. Last time, the strikers actively placed piles of rubbish in streets, drawing attention to the mess. 

But it remained orderly this time, so much so that the municipality told The Mercury, on day six of the strike, that it was “unaware of any service disruptions due to a strike”.

This was most puzzling. 

It had this newspaper actually going out to uMlazi to find piles of uncollected refuse. Were the collectors, who had confirmed the strike, unreliable? But there the heaps were.

It seems unfortunate that repeated failure was because of an exhausted budget at Durban Solid Waste. 

As much as R45million had been set aside for six months for these contracted collectors in the townships - but it had been devoured in two.

It appears, too, that much of this is to blame on uncapped costs that collectors can claim - in addition to their fixed contracts - in clearing illegal dump sites in the townships.

Why was this costly outflow, this drain, not blocked promptly after the first episode?

Durban residents need to be told exactly what happened here. Who, in this climate of abuse of government purses, allowed unlimited access to city funds?

As well as ending the strike, the council must put in place safeguards to ensure no further recurrences.
