Durban - The Department of Higher Education believes that there should be a tightening of access controls across all universities.

The statement, made by the chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Higher Education and Training, Connie September, comes days after a student was gunned down, allegedly by her ex-boyfriend at a residence in Durban.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

September said universities needed to tighten residential security as the new-found freedom among many students could unintentionally expose them to abuse.

“The committee sends its deepest condolences to the family of the deceased. We are extremely shocked and saddened that this tragedy happened on one of our campuses. Zolile Khumalo did not deserve to die like this,” she said.

September said they were interested to find out who gave the man access to the residence and based of what motivation.

She called on MUT to investigate the incident thoroughly, leaving no stone unturned.

“If it is found that the former student had worked with current students in accessing the residences, those students should be identified and disciplined accordingly. Murder of female students on campuses is despicable. These are the same students who are still battling rape culture and recognition in academia. A situation where campuses become places of torment should not be allowed,” she said.

It is alleged that the Khumalo’s ex-boyfriend, Thabani Mzolo, gained entry to the Lonsdale residence in Durban, where he is believed to have shot Khumalo. Mzolo has since appeared in court on a charge of murder and the possession of an illegal firearm. He was remanded in custody and is due back in court again this week. He is expected to apply for bail. Khumalo was studying towards a degree in quantity surveying.
