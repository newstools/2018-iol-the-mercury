Netcare 911 spokesperson, Shawn Herbst, said when they arrived at the scene in  Umhlangane Road, a private ambulance service was already at the scene. 

"We were called to assist. Paramedics fervently tried to save the man's life but tragically his injuries were too severe and was unfortunately declared deceased at the scene. The police were at the scene and have cordoned off the road to traffic," he said. 

On Monday, Sadia Sukhraj died in hospital after she was shot in her abdomen when three men allegedly tried to hijack her father's car. 

Sukhraj was seated inside a Hyundai iX35 while her father had gone to drop off her little brother.
