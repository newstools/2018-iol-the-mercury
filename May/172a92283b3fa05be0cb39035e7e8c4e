Police spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbhele, said a joint operation led by the Newcastle FCS Commander Captain Nagesh Moothilal, Newcastle K9 Unit and Madadeni SAPS members yielded positive results when they rescued the three children. 

"The team proceeded to a house at Inverness place in Osizweni where three children were kept hostage by the suspects. A total of five suspects aged between 20 and 70 were arrested. They were also found in possession of an unlicensed pistol.  The hijacked vehicle was recovered at Osizweni, C section.  It is believed that one of the suspects who orchestrated the carjacking and kidnapping is a relative of the victims whilst another is a close family friend. The suspects demanded a ransom from the family for the safe release of the children," she said. 

"The arrested suspects will appear at the Madadeni Magistrates’ Court tomorrow on charges of carjacking, kidnapping and possession of an unlicensed firearm. An additional charge of human trafficking will also be added," Mbhele said.
