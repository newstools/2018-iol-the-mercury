They were arrested following a violent riot on the N3 on Sunday night in which 35 trucks were damaged. According to police spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbhele, a group of people began throwing objects on the N3 freeway and had set some trucks alight.

"A total of 35 trucks were damaged including those that were set alight. It is believed that the people who were protesting and throwing stones as well as burning objects, had causing extensive damages to property," she said. 

Following the riot, groceries such as meat, burger patties, rolls of tissues, floor tiles and toilet paper were recovered when the police stormed the area on Monday. 

The eight, aged between 17 and 46 face charges of public violence and possession of property suspected to be stolen. 

Despite a heavy police presence in the area and around the courthouse, residents remained relatively calm.
