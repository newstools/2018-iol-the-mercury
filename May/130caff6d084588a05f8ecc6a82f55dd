Durban - Mangosuthu University of Technology students said they do not feel safe at their residences. Their comments come on the back of the murder of a 21-year-old student, allegedly shot by her ex-boyfriend. 
Students were speaking to The Mercury outside the Durban High Court where they gathered to show support for Zolile Khumalo, who was murdered on May 1. 
"MUT student, Nomagugu Mthembu, said students gathered to support the movement against women and child abuse. 
"As students, we feel very bad. We feel unsafe in our own residences. We are here to show support for the memory of Zolile Khumalo. We are here to ensure that justice is served," she said. 

The accused, Thabani Mzolo, made his first appearance in court on Thursday. He is accused of murder and the possession of an illegal firearm. Mzolo, 23, a former MUT student, allegedly shot Khumalo, a first year quantity surveying student, at the Lonsdale residence in the Durban Central Business District. It is alleged that he gained access to the res via another student, who opened the gate for him. 

Mzolo was remanded in custody pending his next court appearance. 
Khumalo's death has sparked a widespread outcry from a number of political parties and anti-abuse organisations, condemning the murder. 
Earlier in the day, students marched to the Durban Magistrate's Court to show their outrage at the murder.

MUT SRC President, Sandile Dlamini, said there was enough evidence for the court to Mzolo to jail and not grant him bail. 
He said he has asked MUT to arrange for counselling for the female student who witnessed the shooting. 
"They need to arrange psychological counselling for her because she needs to be in a good frame of mind when she returns to campus," he said. 
Dlamini said he has been in contact with Khumalo's family who are battling to come to terms with the murder. 
He rubbished claims that MUT had an outsourced security company guarding the res. 
"That is nonsense. If a university sends a person to a building, that person is registered with the university and not with the building," Dlamini said.
