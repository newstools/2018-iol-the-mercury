Durban - With the one millionth man being circumcised in KwaZulu-Natal at the weekend, the KZN Department of Health has set its sights on one million more being following suit. The exercise was part of a high profile community outreach programme and was attended by Isilo SamaBandla, KZN Premier Willies Mchunu, IFP leader Inkosi Mangosuthu Buthelezi and other dignitaries. KZN MEC for health, Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo, said now that this milestone had been reached, the big challenge for the province is to accelerate its efforts and circumcise another one million men soon. KwaMashu-born actor, Melusi Yeni, was the one millionth man to be circumcised, prompting Dhlomo to add that Yeni could not help recruit more men to get circumcised. "We have to circumcise another one million men soon. Once we do that, we will have significantly lowered the numbers of new HIV infections. However, let me add that Medical Male Circumcision(MMC) is not a license for sexually irresponsible behaviour," he said. "Do not make the mistake of behaving anyhow. Do not make the mistake of having unprotected sex just because you are circumcised. If you test positive, you will be counselled and administered treatment. If you test negative, you must strive to remain negative for as long as you live," Dhlomo said. According to the DoH, MMC has been found, by scientists, to lower the chances of female-male transmission of HIV by 60%. It also makes the male genitalia easier to clean, reduces the risk of acquiring some sexually transmitted infections - whether the person is HIV+ or HIV- and it may reduce a man's risk of penile cancer and a woman's risk of cervical cancer. The Mercury
