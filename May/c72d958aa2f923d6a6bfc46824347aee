Durban - On May 21, Thulani Mzinyane, began walking to Durban from Johannesburg. The local DJ, also known as DJ Dash, set about to raise much-needed funding to build a school and collect food parcels for disadvantaged kids around South Africa.

Under the banner of his organisation, Feed a Child Feed a Nation,  Mzinyane has worked on a number of charity drives. AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

“Feed a Child Feed a Nation is an initiative that aims to alleviate poverty through providing food to underprivileged children in under-resourced schools. This initiative was established in 2012 and I arrange events with various clubs around Durban where different artists come to perform at no cost. The monies raised at these events is used to buy food parcels which are then donated to different schools around the province,” he said. 

This is not the first walk undertaken by Mzinyane. In 2012, 2013, 2016 and 2017, Mzinyane walked hundreds of kilometres to raise funds and for other causes. 

“In 2017, I walked from Pretoria to Johannesburg to raise awareness for child malnutrition. This year, with this walk, I plan to collect food parcels as well. We aim to feed over 20 000 children from around SA,” he said. 

Mzinyane works with teachers to identify children in schools who are most impacted by poverty. 

“We try to see for those children who do not know where their next meal is coming from,” he said.

Mzinyane will reach Durban early next month.
