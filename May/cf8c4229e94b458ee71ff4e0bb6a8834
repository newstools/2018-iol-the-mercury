Mogadishu - More than 20 people have died after tropical cyclone Sagar hit the Horn of Africa over the weekend, authorities
told dpa on Monday.

Abdirahman Ahmed Ali, a provincial governor in the breakaway state of Somaliland, said seven children were among the dead and hundreds of
homes had been destroyed.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

Roads have been rendered inaccessible and hundreds of livestock were also killed by what were the heaviest rains in Somaliland's history,
he added.

Other Somali cities across the country, including the capital Mogadishu - where city authorities said six people had died - have
also been affected by the cyclone.

The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported Sunday that "tens of thousands of people have been affected by
flooding, displacement and the destruction of infrastructure in Sagar's wake."
