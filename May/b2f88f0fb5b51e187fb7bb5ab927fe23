Durban - More than 7 000 people from 80 countries are expected to attend the Africa’s Travel Indaba, to be held in Durban for the 26th consecutive year. Durban last year won the bid to host Indaba for five more years, cementing the city’s place as South Africa’s tourism playground.

Previously known as Tourism Indaba, the event is one of the largest tourism marketing events on the African continent. As such, a focus on Africa means a bigger African presence. ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

There will be 31 African countries represented at Indaba, 13 more than last year. 

Phindile Makwakwa, acting chief executive officer of Tourism KZN, believes the continent’s tourism industry has great potential to expand as it offers nature/adventure tourism, cultural heritage tourism, and travel for wellness, health and retirement purposes, which have recently been in high demand. 

The various offerings around the continent, and the world will be showcased at the exhibition, exhibitors will participate in 20 000 meetings to be held during the three day event between May 8 and May 10. 

The economic direct spent for the Indaba is expected to be about R53 million, however, according to MEC for Economic Development and Tourism Sihle Zikalala, the it is expected to inject R89 million to KwaZulu-Natal’s GDP.

“The tourism showpiece has brought major spin offs for the tourism industry and associated businesses, big and small in KZN. Indaba is crucial to us as tourism is a key sector for spurring inclusive economic growth and employment creation,” Zikalala said.

The event itself will create  200 part time jobs.
