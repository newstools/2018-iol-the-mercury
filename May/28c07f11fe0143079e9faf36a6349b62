Sadia was shot in a botched hijacking on Monday morning. The nine-year-old girl was rushed to hospital but despite resuscitation efforts, she died a short while later. 



On Thursday, Cele first held a meeting at the Chatsworth police station. Although members of the media were invited to attend Cele's visit at midday at the police station, journalists had to wait outside while Cele spoke to police officials and management. The meeting was to discuss the riots that broke out at the police station on Monday.

Scores of residents made their way to the police station, demanding an increase in police visibility and a tougher stance on crime-fighting. What was meant to be a peaceful demonstration turned violent with police using rubber bullets and stun grenades to disperse the crowd. Twenty people were arrested for public violence. They appeared in the Chatsworth Magistrates Court on Wednesday where 17 were granted bail of R1000, one of R500 and the case against the 20th person was not registered. 

A man has since appeared in court for the incident. Sibonelo Mkhize was charged with murder, kidnapping and theft. He is believed to have been out on parole at the time on Monday’s attack. Mkhize's bail was denied and he is due back in court next month.
