Every time you shop at Pick n Pay over the next two months and use your Mastercard to make a contactless payment, you will be feeding a South African in need.

Estimates suggest that around 14 million South Africans go hungry every day. 
“We believe this collaboration with our customers and Mastercard will make a huge difference to thousands of poor and vulnerable families across the country,” says Pick n Pay Deputy CEO Richard van Rensburg.
The Tap to Feed campaign will make it possible for any Pick n Pay customer to make a contribution to eliminating hunger by simply using the ‘Tap & Go’ contactless payment option when buying groceries. 

Not only will customers make payment at the till more convenient with quicker transaction times and shorter queues but now they can leave knowing they have made a difference in someone’s life – at no extra cost or effort.

In partnership with Mastercard, the Tap to Feed campaign aims to donate 1.2 million meals to those in need this Mandela Day. This forms part of Mastercard’s global 100 Million Meals programme.

The Tap to Feed campaign will run from 7 May to 20 July 2018 in Pick n Pay stores countrywide. All meals will be donated to FoodForward SA who will distribute the meals through its network of non-profit organisations (NPOs), with a focus on vulnerable women and children.

“We understand there is a still a long road ahead to eradicate hunger in South Africa, but we believe that every action, no matter how small, can lead to something significant. And in this case, the action required is as small as choosing to tap your Mastercard rather than swiping it. This great partnership between our customers and partners can make a significant contribution to a better South Africa,” said Van Rensburg
