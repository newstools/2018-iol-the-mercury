Durban - Hundreds of community members in Mbuthumeni village outside Harding, southern KwaZulu-Natal, have been digging day and night believing that they will strike it rich with the discovery of “gold” in the area.
This comes after road construction workers, who had been digging in the area, found glittery rocks almost two weeks ago.



People are travelling from as far as Durban, Pietermaritzburg, the Eastern Cape and Johannesburg to witness the spectacle, but mainly to try to find gold for themselves.

While many hope and believe it’s gold, others just think it’s “fool’s gold”.

The area falls under traditional leadership of iNkosi Mthetho Machi and by extension also belongs to the Ingonyama Trust.

When The Mercury visited yesterday, the site was a hive of activity with more than 2000 people digging, while youngsters carrying digging tools were running out with bags full of “gold ”.

The police, however, halted the mining yesterday and closed the site for safety reasons.

The site has been cordoned off with barbed wire, and a security company has been appointed to look after the site to prevent illegal mining.

The security company is believed to have been hired by Machi.

On Tuesday, two people were hospitalised after they were injured during a rockfall. One sustained head injuries and another sustained back injuries.

Some of the impromptu miners who spoke to The Mercury said they had come to the site because they had heard about the gold.

Khimbili Ndlovu, from Bizana in the Eastern Cape, said he had not been aware of the “gold rush” when he came to the area to visit his sister. 

“My sister told me that there was wealth to be found here, and so I came,” Ndlovu added.

Leaning against his shovel as he watched those digging, he said he was hopeful the discovery would lead to the opening of a mine.

“I have been digging but so far I have found nothing;
I doubt I will because the police are closing down the site,” he said.

Mandi Jaji said he had travelled from Umzimkhulu after hearing about the discovery.

“I live just an hour away, and there was no way I could sit at home while history was being made.”

Jaji said he was certain that gold would be discovered there. 

“I took some samples of the soil and I will show them to the illegal miners in Joburg. But from what I have seen, there is something there.

“The colour of the soil is silver; we just need to start digging deeper into the ground,” he said.

Jaji said it was important for the site to be protected as it was becoming dangerous, with rocks beginning to fall.

“Tomorrow I believe there will be a meeting with the traditional leaders to decide what must be done with this land, and hopefully they will donate it so that the mine could be developed,” he said.

Local residents who have mined some rocks are charging people between R50 and R200 a piece. Almost everyone living close to the mining area has a piece of “gold” to sell.

Some of the traders who spoke to The Mercury yesterday were hoping for experts to assess the value of their 
precious metal as they were concerned that they might have underpriced their rocks.

The ward councillor, Hopewell Ngubelanga, said that if the discovery proved genuine, it would bring a lot of changes to the area. 



He said he believed that samples had been taken to be tested for gold.

“This could create a lot of job opportunities for the people of this area. 

“I am, however, concerned about what is happening with people rushing to the site, because mining needs to be managed, otherwise people are going to start dying,” he said.

The residents were not the only ones happy about the discovery - at least one hardware dealer said he was doing a roaring trade.

“Some people come to purchase digging equipment on credit, saying they will pay at the end of the month,” said Kalil Irshad.

“Previously, I sold one or two chisels a week, now I am selling five a day, five or six big hammers, and shovels and axes,” he said.
