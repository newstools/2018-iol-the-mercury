Durban - Three children between the ages of six and eleven were kidnapped during an alleged hijacking on Monday morning in Madadeni Section 7, Newcastle.

The siblings, two girls and a boy were being transported by their uncle - along with three other children - when a group of men waved the driver down, indicating that there was a problem with his tyre. AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

The driver stopped near Qaphelani School to check his tyres when the men allegedly threatened him with firearms.

"The suspects pulled him out of the vehicle and the passengers screamed," said police spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbhele.

The hijackers fled the scene in a silver BMW with three of the children still inside the car. 

The police are searching for the hijackers and the three children who were taken during the incident.

A case of carjacking is being investigated by Madadeni SAPS.
