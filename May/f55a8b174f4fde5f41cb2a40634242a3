"The case against one of the suspects was not enrolled in court. The case was remanded to July 4," he said. 

The 20 were nabbed on charges of public violence. On Monday, thousands of residents made their way to the Chatsworth police station to protest for visible police presence in the community after a nine-year-old girl was fatally wounded in a botched hijacking. 

Residents said they were fed up with crime in their community. 

Residents burnt tyres, blockaded the road with burning tyres and hurled objects at the station premises. Police had to use stun grenade to disperse the unruly crowd.
