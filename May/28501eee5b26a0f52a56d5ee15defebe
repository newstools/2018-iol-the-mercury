Durban - The Durban community of Manor Gardens is mourning the loss of a local crime-fighter. Don Stead was killed in a freak crash on Monday afternoon. It is believed that Stead and a friend were fixing his motorbike when he tried to kick-start it down the driveway of his Rand Road home. It is alleged that the cable on the motorbike jammed. Stead who was in his 70s, crashed through a fence across from his house and landed down the embankment. Garrith Jamieson, Operations Director at Rescue Care, said they were called out to the scene just after 3pm. Stead was pronounced dead at the scene. Neighbours gathered outside Stead's home and remarked on his personality and diligent attitude to keeping crime at bay in the leafy suburb. He had initiated a number of WhatsApp crime alert groups in Manor Gardens and would often inform residents of incidents in the area. Janus Horn, Sica's Guesthouse General Manager and who worked closely with Stead in his community efforts, was at the scene shortly after the crash. "Don will always be remembered as a man that made a difference to the well-being of all residents in Manor Gardens. His passion was security and setting up Whatsapp groups. It is a man taken far too young and he will be missed by all. RIP Don," Horn said. The Mercury
