Rescue Care Operations Director, Garreth Jamieson, said Sukhraj was rushed to a nearby hospital. 

"Her injuries were too severe and she passed away despite resuscitation efforts," he said. 

A man, allegedly involved in the hijacking attempt, was shot dead and a second man was arrested. Police combed the area for a third man.
