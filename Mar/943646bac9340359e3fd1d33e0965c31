Durban - Former President Jacob Zuma's Nkandla homestead has once again being the centre of an investigation, this time about alleged animal neglect. 
Marcelle Meredith executive director of the National Council of SPCAs (NSPCA) said on Thursday that they had received a report that there was allegedly only security guard at the premises leaving nobody to take charge and care for the animals. ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
"An NSPCA inspector attended to the complaint and was denied entry by the security personnel on duty. He then approached the court and was granted a warrant to enter the property and inspect the animals but was still denied entry due to it being a National Key Point," she said. 

The inspector then approached the relevant officials and was finally granted entry to inspect the conditions under which the animals were being kept. It was found that no animals had been abandoned. There were welfare concerns noted at the time of the inspection and a warning was issued. The warning was subsequently complied with and the NSPCA will continue to monitor the animals at the homestead.

 “The NSPCA will always follow through and investigate when a complaint is received, it does not matter who the owner of the animals are or where in South Africa the animals are situated – we will continue to be the protectors of the voiceless no matter what challenges are thrown at us” said Meredith. 

Two weeks ago, Jason Arnold of Universal Reptiles, was called to Zuma's house to investigate and look for snakes which had recently been seen around the homestead. None were found but a Arnold did discover the skin of a non-venomous spotted bush snake.
