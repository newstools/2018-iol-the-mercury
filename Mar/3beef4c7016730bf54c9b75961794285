Spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said on Wednesday, that the firearms were confiscated with 1159 rounds of ammunition in different operations  around the province including Msinga, KwaMashu and Phoenix. 

The recovered firearms include 136 pistols, 14 high caliber firearms and four homemade firearms. All the firearms have been sent for ballistic testing to determine whether they were used in the commission of crime in the country or can assist in solving pending cases.   

Acting Provincial Commissioner Major General Bheki said these operations are aimed at eradicating the proliferation of unlicensed firearms. "We will continue to make the province more safer for the citizens. We urge the community to report all those in possession of unlicensed firearms within their communities to the police, since confiscation of those firearms will save unnecessary loss of lives as well as other serious and violent crimes,” he said.
