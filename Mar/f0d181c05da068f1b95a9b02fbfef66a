An interim interdict brought by the Avbob Group against the National Funeral Practitioners Association of South Africa (Nafupa SA) was made final by the Durban High Court on Tuesday. 


The court interdict bars the group from conducting unlawful protests or gathering at any of Avbob’s branches, or preventing anyone from entering or leaving.

It also prohibits them preventing, disrupting or interfering with their business or making threats to do so. 

They were also ordered to remove from social media platforms; “all notices, publications and information relating to their #abaphume and #abahambe campaign.” 


Neither Nafupa President Muzi Hlengwa or any of the members cited as respondents were present in court. Instead, Hlengwa’s wife Bee told the court he was ill and she had brought his doctors note.
