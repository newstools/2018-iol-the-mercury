The current political environment and statements such as ‘Kill the Boer, kill the farmer’ from prominent government officials and parliamentarians have left many South Africans, and in particular the white minority, fearing for their lives.”Potgieter, who has been campaigning for her two adult children living in South Africa to join her, called for the government's offer to be extended to include non-farmers as well.“We remain painfully aware that many of our family members who are not farmers remain exposed to unacceptable levels of violence,” she said. “We would therefore also like to discuss the current family member visa scheme and its design,” said Potgieter .IOL
