SDCEA's Desmond D’sa aid they had noticed fresh spillage yesterday. 
“We asked the officials from the eThekwini municipality to test the water and they took the water samples for testing in their municipal laboratory in Pinetown.”
He said it was difficult to determine where the spillage was coming from as there were many companies in the area. 
“We  received complaints from fishermen in the area about the spillage,” he said. 
D’sa said the failure to contain the “regular”toxic spillages to the beach would drive fishermen out of the area and increase the levels of poverty in the South Durban community.
"We ask that there be increase enforcement and sanctions applied to those who violate the by –laws of our beautiful beaches and city. Industrial waste can have a serious impact on both human and marine life."
