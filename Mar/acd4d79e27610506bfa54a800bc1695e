Durban- Three people were seriously injured when they were crushed by an industrial printing machine at a warehouse in Tongaat on Monday. 

Netcare spokesperson Shawn Herbst said one of the men suffered a partial amputation, leaving his bone exposed. ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

According to Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa) said the men were offloading the machine- which weighs several tons- from a truck using a crane when the restraints snapped and it fell onto them.

Herbst said the crane is fixed onto the truck on which the machine was being offloaded. 

“It seems when the weight of the machine seems to have lifted the front of the truck off the ground, then the rigging setup allegedly failed causing the load to come crashing down on the patient,” he said. 

When they arrived, Durban firefighters had managed to reattach the machine onto the crane and lift it up to free the men. 

They were stabilised and transported to hospital.
