City traffic spokesperson Maxine Bezuidenhout said officers stopped a Toyota Avanza travelling on the N2 in the bus lane between Jakes Gerwel Drive and Bhunga Avenue.

The driver, a 61-year-old man, was unable to produce a valid driver’s license, and the officer picked up a strong scent of alcohol on his breath, Bezuidenhout said.

"The driver failed the breath testing giving a reading of 0,63mg/1000ml breath more than 5 times over the legal limit of 0.10mg/1000ml breath. The driver was arrested and detained at Athlone SAPS for further investigation. The scholars were safely transported to school by a member of the Road Haulage Unit to ensure their safe arrival at school," Bezuidenhout said.

The driver was transporting 14 scholars between the ages of 6 and 10 years to two primary schools within the Cape Town CBD, namely Chapel Street Primary School and Rahmoniyeh Primary School.
