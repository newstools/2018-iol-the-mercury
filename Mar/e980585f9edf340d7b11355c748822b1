This was revealed by Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi at a press briefing at the offices of the National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD) in Johannesburg on Sunday. 

Following the results of tests which came in at midnight on Saturday, Motsoaledi said source of the present listeriosis outbreak is the Enterprise factory in Polokwane. 

Products from RCL foods, (formerly Rainbow Chicken) and Enterprise would be recalled in South Africa and abroad where they are exported.  

Since the beginning of January last year,  948 people have been infected with listeriosis. 

Although the alarm was raised last year, the source eluded authorities. 

The NICD however, had warned that soft cheeses, and unpasteurised milk and dairy products should be avoided by persons who are at risk of listeriosis. Of particular concern were processed, ready-to-eat meat products such as viennas, polonies, russians, ham, other ‘cold’ meats, sausages, various corned meats, salami, pepperoni and similar products. “These should be  avoided, or thoroughly cooked in boiling water or heated at high temperatures of 70°C or higher before eating.”


Most cases- 555, were reported in Gauteng , 116 in the  Western Cape and 66 in KwaZulu-Natal.
