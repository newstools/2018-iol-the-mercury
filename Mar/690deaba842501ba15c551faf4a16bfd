"Our technicians are on site investigating the problem and electricity has been restored in some areas," she said in a brief statement. 

Mthethwa said the City  was making an appeal for patience while we work around the clock to restore power in all affected areas.

"Areas in the Northern, Western and Southern regions of the City are still without power and electricity is expected to be restored in the next few hours. However, power has been restored in some areas across the City. Technicians are on site to assess the damage and the cause of the explosion.

A message from an eThekwini electricity staff member sought to allay fears saying they have had a failure on their 275Kva transformer.

“Do not panic. Our guys are working on it.”

The substation at Marrianhill, west of Durban apparently blew up.

Affected areas included some parts of the CDB, Phoenix, Amanzimtoti, Hillcrest, Berea, Umbilo, oThongathi and as far as Hammarsdale.

The chaotic situation was felt mostly by motorists who inundated The Mercury with panicky calls as street lights went off.

“It’s all chaos here in Berea and one truck that was doing a u-turn jack-knifed at the dead traffic lights and it took half an hour for the driver to free it as traffic pile-up drove everyone mad,” said a motorist.

The City said it was investigating the cause of the power failure.
