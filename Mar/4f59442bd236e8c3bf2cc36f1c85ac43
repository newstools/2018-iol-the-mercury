Farming co-operatives and small business enterprises in KwaZulu-Natal are set to receive a R57 million to boost their ability to participate in food production. 

The Department of Economic Development, Tourism and Environmental Affairs has set aside this amount for the sector, as part of Radical Agrarian Socio-Economic Transformation (Raset). ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

Announcing this at the an entrepreneurship summit at the Durban University of Technology recently, MEC Sihle Zikalala said the Raset is a programme of the KZN government and sought to improve the participation by small scale farmers in the lucrative food production value chain.

“It strives to solve the socio-economic problem of rural and township communities in particular by empowering them to create their own wealth in order to provide jobs, eradicate poverty and redress economic imbalances,” said Zikalala. 

He said they were in partnership with the grocery retailers Spar Group who would  provide technical and back office support for rural shops which also serve as pension and social grant pay points. “Our district development agencies have also been allocated a revolving facility which will enable them to pay farmers who bring them produce for the Raset programme. Details of how our emerging farmers are going to benefit from this funding will be unveiled during our budget speech in the next few weeks,” said Zikalala.

More than 1000 co-operatives and small businesses are expected to benefit.
