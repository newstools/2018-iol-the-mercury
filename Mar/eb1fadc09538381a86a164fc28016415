Police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane said they were still hunting more suspects who managed to escape. 

They are alleged to have blown up an ATM at a shopping centre in Madadeni, Newcastle on Wednesday night. Responding to the scene of the explosion, police came under fire. 

Three bystanders were shot and wounded but one died in hospital. 

“The suspects managed to escape in their getaway vehicle towards Utrecht Road. Police continued chasing the suspects and reinforcements were called in from neighbouring police stations and units,” said Zwane. 

When police caught up with the vehicle and attempted to stop it, they again came under fire, no one was shot in this exchange but the suspects managed to get away. 

The chase continued to a homestead in KwaMdakane area near Dannhauser. “When police approached the homestead, they came under attack again. During the exchange of gunfire two suspects were fatally wounded,” said Zwane. 

Three firearms, a R5 rifle, an AK47 rifle and a pistol were recovered from the scene. Cases of armed robbery, murder, attempted murder, possession of unlicensed firearm and ammunition were opened for further investigation. 


Acting Provincial Commissioner Major General Bheki Langa expressed concern at how dangerous criminals attack police who are performing their duties. “Our police officers  always come under attack when approaching armed suspects and that cannot be tolerated. The police will defends themselves if attacked by these heavily armed suspects. It is obvious that these criminals have no mercy and shoot anyone that comes in their way,” he said.
