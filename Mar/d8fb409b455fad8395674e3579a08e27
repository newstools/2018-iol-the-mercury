Mduduzi Mnqayi, the secretary general of the SRC, at the university said the protests were triggered by the delays in the disbursement of the NSFAS meal allowances.

According to Mnqayi, each student is entitled to an allowance of R1500 per month. 
“Unfortunately there was a delay in this and out of frustration the students then protested demanding that their meal allowances be deposited. The University has committed that by tomorrow money will be deposited into all the accounts,” he said.
Mnqayi described the situation as “not yet normal” but added that police were doing in their power to restore calm. A student who spoke on condition of anonymity said the rioting students had also looted the dining hall.
Police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane said university students had allegedly set a building and two police vehicles alight during a protest. 

"Mtunzini police and Public Order Police are at the scene to calm the crowd. More than ten students have been arrested and they will be charged for public violence. They will appear in court soon."

On Tuesday, students at the Mangosuthu University of Technology held a protest over unpaid NSFAS allowances.
