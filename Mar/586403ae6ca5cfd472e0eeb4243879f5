GO!Durban, the city’s integrated public transport network, is expected to hit the road later this year. 

The transport system which will run from the Pinetown’s CBD to KwaMashu’s Bridge City, is a game-changer for the city, said eThekwini Mayor Zandile Gumede. ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

“Globally we have seen how transport systems, have worked to improve the liveability of a city and unlock economic and social opportunities. So our first provision of a route in an area so in need of opportunities and development, is very exciting,” she said. 

Areas and precincts along the route have begun to attract investors and interest in developments, as the transport network now has the potential to attract critical mass to stimulate economic growth. Along the routes, upgrades of urban precinct nodes with new lighting, street furniture and landscaping, have already begun to alter the way in which people use these spaces, making for much more user-friendly and safer environments.

 

“Our message to citizens, from commuters, operators and businesses – small, medium and large, is that as a city we can deliver the infrastructure and systems, but ultimately it is yours to embrace, look after and utilise for the betterment of all. This is a legacy project which means getting around the City and accessing opportunities will continue to improve, and in that there is enormous hope,” said Gumede.
