Ngcobo was arrested on Friday for theft of medical supplies including syringes and needles from his workplace at the Phoenix Community Health Centre. 

Health MEC Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo, who was in court on Monday, said the department wanted to thank the security company that had raised the alarm about the theft.

On Sunday, the department said that Ngcobo had been suspended pending disciplinary processes but on Monday, Dhlomo said Ngcobo had submitted a resignation letter.

“I've heard from the manager of the centre that (Ngcobo) has submitted is resignation letter, we accept that letter. We will conduct an internal investigation with the help of our (security) cameras to find out what exactly happened that day,”Dhlomo said. 

He said they will also  be engaging with the Nursing Council body which Ngcobo belongs to find out whether his behavior has not brought the council into disrepute. 

The case has been postponed to next month for further investigation.
