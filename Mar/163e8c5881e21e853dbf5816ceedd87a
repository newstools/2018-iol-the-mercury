The four driver licence examiners, clerk, cleaner and nine learner licence applicants were nabbed in Howick in the KwaZulu Natal Midlands after a year-long investigation, said Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) in a statement on Tuesday. 

 The bust was a joint operation by the Road Traffic Management Corporation’s National Traffic Anti-Corruption Unit, the Hawks and KwaZulu Natal Traffic and Transport Inspectorate Unit.

 During the investigation, officials from the Howick driver learner testing centre were observed engaging in unethical and corrupt conduct at the centre.

 

An arrest warrant has been issued for one more official and more arrests were expected as the investigations continued. 

RTMC spokesman Simon Zwane said; “Corruption related to the issuing of driving licence documents is a major concern and is believed to contribute significantly to road accidents is South Africa.

 

About 80% of fatal crashes are attributed to human error and the ability of the drivers to handle the vehicle plays an important role in this.”
