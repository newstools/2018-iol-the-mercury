KwaZulu-Natal emergency workers have threatened to shutdown paramedic and mortuary services during the busy Easter period, if their demands are not met.

A handful of these workers marched to the ANC provincial offices on Monday, demanding the party intervene. They want the ANC to hold health MEC Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo accountable for “contraventions” of labour court judgements in their favour over salaries and special payments.





“We have engaged with comrade (Premier Willis) Mchunu and comrade Dhlomo to no prevail, further we have followed all labour forum but the officials and comrade Dhlomo are refusing to implement court decisions and DPSA (Department of Public Service and Administration) instructions. Instead, they threaten us with dismissal. Already, others are dismissed thus leaving us with no choice but to approach the organisation (ANC),” read the memorandum.

Verbal blows exchanged between ANC KZN's Super Zuma and ex paramedic Sfiso Zuma over deadline for response to memorandum.

The marchers were led by axed paramedic Sfiso Dlamini who got into verbal blows with ANC representative Super Zuma, over the marchers demand that the ANC respond within seven days. If this is not done, they will “camp” outside the ANC provincial offices during Easter, leaving the province without "anyone to pick up bodies or treat and transport the sick and injured."

Zuma  said they could not agree to the deadline as there was no telling how long the process would take. “We will process the memorandum and take it to the relevant structure. If there are people who need to account, we will call them to account. I hear you on the seven days, but we work on the process and not within a time frame,” he said.
