KwaZulu-Natal Emergency Medical Services spokesperson Rob Mckenzie said the crash happened on the R74 between Bergville and Harrismith just after 10am on Tuesday morning.  

McKenzie said the six women and one child were declared dead on the scene while four more people were treated for critical injuries by paramedics before being transported to hospital for further care. 

The cause of the crash is not known at this stage. 

In a separate incident, 16 people were injured in two collisions on the  M13 before the Dawncliff turnoff in Cowies Hill. 

ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring said paramedics arrived on the first scene to find that a light motor vehicle had rolled, coming to a stop upright in the middle of the road. Three people were found walking around dazed on the scene.

They were assessed and found to have sustained minor to moderate injuries.

“While attending to the first scene, a second collision occurred a short distance down the road. A taxi rear-ended another,” said Meiring. 

Thirteen people sustained minor to moderate injuries and were transported to various hospitals for treatment.
