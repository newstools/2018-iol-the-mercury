A man who gave police false information that a group of Glebelands residents had firearms, has himself been found with an unlicensed firearm and implicated in murder and attempted murder cases at the infamous hostel.

Police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane said on Sunday that the 29-year-old man sent police based at the Umlazi hostel on a wild goose chance but when the group he pointed police to was searched, no firearms were found. “Later on, the members became suspicious about the person who gave them information and he was approached and searched. He was found in possession of a .38 special revolver with it’s serial number erased. There were also five live rounds from the firearm.”ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
