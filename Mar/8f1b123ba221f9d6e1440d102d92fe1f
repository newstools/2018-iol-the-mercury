Durban- DA leader in KwaZulu-Natal Zwakele Mncwango is to due to hand over a dossier to the Hawks detailing alleged instances of corruption in the eThekwini Municipality.

 Mncwango revealed this on Monday following a meeting he held with the head of the Hawks in the province General Jabulani Zikhali.

The dossier will include some of the forensic reports that have been leaked to the media and opposition parties by whistleblowers. Most of these forensic reports were a product of investigations launched to probe the awarding of various tenders, some of which were found to be irregular.

One of these details how a R90 million tender for the manufacturing and supply of the orange recycling plastic bags was awarded to a company that investigators was ineligible.  That report recommends that criminal charges be laid against the company and its director while recommending internal disciplinary proceedings against some officials..

Emerging from the meeting with Zikhali, Mncwango told reporters that the Hawks had shown interest in investigating these matters but had asked the DA to prioritise the cases and not overflood them with information.

Mncwango said he was frustrated because “nothing happens in most cases”.

He said the officials were also getting frustrated over non-action on these matters hence the reports were getting leaked.

“As of Monday we have committed to provide them with a priority list in terms of which report we want dealt with a priority,” Mncwango said.
