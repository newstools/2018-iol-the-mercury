Ipid spokesman Moses Dlamini, said the police officers had allegedly been searching for drugs Tshuma’s home.

“They further alleged that the deceased resisted arrest and that they had used minimum force to effect the arrest,” said Dlamini. However, when they arrived at the police station, he was found dead in the back of the van.

“Witnesses alleged that the deceased was assaulted at his home. The post mortem showed that the deceased was assaulted,” said Dlamini.

The police officers are expected to appear at the Madadeni Magistrates Court  on Tuesday, each charged with murder.
