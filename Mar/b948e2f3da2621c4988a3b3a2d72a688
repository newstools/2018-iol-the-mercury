DURBAN – Quinton de Kock and David Warner were involved in a heated confrontation at tea on the fourth day of the first Test between South Africa and Australia at Kingsmead.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

Independent Media obtained CCTV footage of the incident, which started at the bottom of the stairs going up to the team dressing-rooms.

The scuffle saw several players on both teams getting involved, including captains Faf du Plessis and Steve Smith, who tried to separate the fracas.

It followed a playing session where Australia were frustrated by a strong Proteas rearguard, led by centurion Aiden Markram and supported by Theunis de Bruyn and then De Kock.

In the footage, Warner is visibly agitated and remonstrating with De Kock, and is pulled away by Usman Khawaja before several other players got involved at the lobby of the two dressing-rooms.

A shirtless Du Plessis is seen in discussion with Warner, before both teams eventually make it into their dressing-rooms.

Markram had confirmed that there had been plenty of words exchanged on the field, and it comes on the back of the tourists requesting the stump microphones to be turned down between balls.

The series had been played in a competitive but fair manner until the fourth day, when tempers got heated.

CCTV footage of the incident involving David Warner and Quinton de Kock.
When AB de Villiers was run out, he had the ball dropped right next to his body by Nathan Lyon after he had dived in vain to make his ground.

It is unclear at this stage if either of the team’s management has seen the footage.
