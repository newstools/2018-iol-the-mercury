Mhlengi Gwala, spoke to The Mercury just before going into surgery on Wednesday morning.

The 26-year-old said three men approached him while he was doing his daily cycling training on Rick Turner (Francois) Road  in the early hours of Tuesday morning.

“They grabbed me from the bike and asked where I was going. Then they pointed a gun at me and I panicked. But they didn’t say anything else and just pulled me into the bushes where they started doing what they did to me,” he said.

Gwala said he was nervous about surgery but hopeful for his recovery.

At his bedside was his best friend and fellow triathlete Sandile Shange. Shange, had been waiting to meet up with Gwala in Umbilo so they could ride together as they always did every morning at 3am. 

Sue de la Porte who had become friends with the pair through the small triathlete community her husband and sons were also in, spoke to The Mercury while waiting for Gwala to get out of the five hour surgery.

“I spoke to the surgeon yesterday and they said the muscles and nerves were severed but to what extent, they can only tell once they are inside. The good news is that they don’t think he will lose his leg which is a huge relief but it’s very difficult to say how bad the damage it at this stage,” said de la Porte.
