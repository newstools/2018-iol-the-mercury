KwaZulu-Natal had the second highest number of new voters registering- 18.78%, which was less than Gauteng with 23.69% and more than Limpopo with 17.03%.
But despite the high number of new voter registrations over the past weekend, Gauteng has the lowest overall registration at 67.3% while 79 of eligible voters in KZN are registered.

With now registered, it brings the voters roll to 26 250 939 voters which is estimated to be about 75% of the eligible voting population based on Stats SAâ€™s voting age population estimates.
