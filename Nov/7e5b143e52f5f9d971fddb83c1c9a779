Durban - Petrol users will get some relief in November with the price of fuel expected to go down by 16 cents while diesel and illuminating paraffin users will pay more.
 This is according to the unaudited month-end fuel price data released by the Central Energy Fund.

 “We expect the petrol price to drop by about 16 cents a litre, and unfortunately, diesel and illuminating paraffin will both increase by about 30 cents a litre,” read a statement issued by the Automobile Association.
 Layton Beard, spokesperson for the AA said the rand is still volatile and it is uncertain what will happen with the exchange rate going forward.
 “We have to see what happens in November. Will there be another decrease or will the price remain stable?” he said.

 The AA said 2018 has been one of the most tumultuous years in history for South African fuel users, and the economy is still fragile and easily spooked.
 People Against Petrol and Paraffin Increases convenor, Visvin Reddy said he welcomes any news where there is a reduction of any kind because it brings some relief however, even at a 16 cents decrease South Africans are still paying the highest price for fuel in this country.
 He said what is worse is that an increase in paraffin and diesel impacts on the most vulnerable people in our society.

 “The poor who don't have access to electricity are still using paraffin to light up their stoves and by increasing paraffin, it is a very insensitive thing on the part of government not to consider the impact that this will have on the poor,”said Reddy.
 Reddy added that diesel is used for public transport and to transport food.
 “So the fact that diesel prices are going up and not coming down means that the government has completely ignored the impact of the fuel price increases,” he said.
