Durban - A Durban schoolboy who started taking photographs with his Buzz Lightyear disposable camera when he was five, was named Young Wildlife Photographer of the Year at a ceremony at the Natural History Museum in London last month.
Now a Grade 10 pupil at Clifton School, Skye Meaker said it was a dream come true to be recognised for an image he described as the embodiment of his love for photography. He won the award for his charming portrait of a leopard waking up after a nap in the Mashatu Game Reserve in Botswana.

The leopard was no stranger to him, as he had been photographing her for seven years. The award-winning image was taken in December 2016.
Meaker said he named the leopard “Limpi” because she broke her leg a while ago and had a slight limp. 
Describing how he managed to capture the moment, Meaker said it wasn’t easy. He spent at least four hours tracking her. 

“We actually got a little tired and I was going to stop for some tea under a tree. But when we got to the tree and looked up, there she was, sleeping on one of the branches,” he said. 
Meaker and his family were flown to London for the prestigious ceremony. 
The grand title image was selected from 19 category winners. Images from professional and amateur photographers were selected by a panel of industry-recognised professionals for their originality, creativity and technical excellence.

Three other South African photographers were also recognised this year: Tertius A Gous (for The meerkat mob), Isak Pretorius (Cool cat) and Susan Scott (Late-night feed).
