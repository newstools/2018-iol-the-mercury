Durban - The union representing workers in the health sector has given Health MEC Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo an ultimatum: fix the health department this week or resign.
The National Education Health and Allied Workers (Nehawu) said it wanted him to table a turnaround plan. 

“We have given Dhlomo until Friday to come up with a plan to address all the challenges workers are facing. If he fails to do that, we want him to resign,” said Zimasile Giyama, Nehawu regional secretary in the Harry Gwala region. 
On Tuesday, Nehawu members, who had called for a meeting with Dhlomo at 12.30pm, arrived at the offices to find the MEC was not there.
“We met senior officials and told them we were only interested in a meeting with the MEC, and we would not let them out of the boardroom until the MEC arrived. We kept them there until 5.55pm when he arrived,” said a source at the meeting.

In a letter the union sent to Dhlomo yesterday, it warned that “the situation at Fort Napier Forensic Pathology has all the potential to become the straw that is about to break the camel’s back”. 
A source said some bodies had been kept for almost 10 years and were decomposing, air conditioners were not working, the smell was unbearable and there was a shortage of tools.
KZN Department of Health spokesperson Ncumisa Mafunda said the allegation that their managers were held hostage was untrue. She said Tuesday’s meeting had been scheduled and was a robust and cordial engagement on matters of mutual interest. 

“The department made a commitment to continue to seek ways to attend to the workers’ concerns as speedily as possible, within its financial constraints,” she said.
