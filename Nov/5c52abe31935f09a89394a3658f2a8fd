Durban - For the past seven days, the South African National Blood Service (SANBS) has experienced a dire shortage of blood, both in KwaZulu-Natal and in other parts of the country.
Sifiso Khoza, SANBS provincial spokesperson, said whatever blood had been donated had been used.

“We are still on 24-hour reserve in KwaZulu-Natal and 48 hours nationally,” he said.
Khoza said certain factors had prevented potential donors from giving blood, resulting in them being turned away. 
“Many people have been on medication because they have not been well. In such a situation, we ask that they wait at least 14 days before they donate,” said Khoza.

As part of the blood drive, said Khoza, the SANBS had dispatched more than 30 mobile units to major shopping centres.
“We do this every year, but for some strange reason we are always caught off-guard even with proper plans in place,” he said.
Khoza said people as young as 16 could donate, with parental consent.

“Anyone can donate from 18 to 65. Even if you are over 65, if your doctor is happy to let you donate, you can donate up to the age of 75,” said Khoza.
Khoza appealed to potential donors to come forward not only when a friend or loved one was in need.
“I would like to thank those who always find the time to help and I appeal to anyone who hasn’t felt the need, because you will find that people feel a need to donate when a relative is in need. It’s actually not about that; it’s about saving the nation,” he said.

He added that one unit of blood could save up to three lives.
“Let’s look at the broader picture - it’s not just about ourselves. It’s about helping your neighbour, helping your friend and helping somebody you might not know,” said Khoza.
