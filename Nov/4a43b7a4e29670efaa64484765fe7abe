Durban - Murdered sex worker Siam Lee's alleged kidnapper and killer is due to appear for indictment in the Durban Magistrate's Court.
Among those that have gathered at the court are sex workers trying to get out of the industry and sex workers who have already escaped it, all from the organisation Kwanele. The group were there to see justice for Siam Lee and to support her family and friends. Siam Lee's mother, Carmen, is also in court.

Siam disappeared from a Durban North brothel in January this year. While the search for her spanned the province, her charred body was found in a sugar cane field near New Hanover two days later.
The accused, a smooth, well-spoken businessman, who is expected to appear in the dock, is out on bail following a lengthy bail application earlier this year.Â He may not be named because one of the charges be faces is the rape of another woman whose identity must be protected.
