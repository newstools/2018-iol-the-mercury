Durban - A 4-year-old girl was burnt to death as she lay asleep on her grandmother’s bed in a corrugated iron shack in Verulam on Saturday night.
Melokuhle Mkhize was left in the care of her grandmother Nokuthula Ndlovu, by her 19-year-old mother, Nondumiso Mkhize, who was busy with her Grade 11 exams.

When The Mercury arrived at the family home, Ndlovu had been picked up by the police and taken to the police station for questioning.
The circumstances surrounding who lit the candle that started the fire are still unclear.
Sabelo Mbuyisa, 10, said he was sitting outside with his brother, Sibusiso, 7, when the fire started after 10pm.

He said his mother had left and the candle inside the house “got finished”, which caused the newspaper it was on to catch alight.
“I ran inside and tried to pull my sister (niece) out, but the blanket was stuck to the bed. My brother and I got burnt. I grabbed my brother and ran outside,” said Sabelo.
Sabelo said the fire started at the foot of the bed because Melokuhle’s legs were burnt.

“We tried to help her, but she was stuck and we left her. She looked like she was sleeping. She got burnt on her legs,” he said.
SAPS spokesperson, Lieutenant- Colonel Thulani Zwane, confirmed that an inquest was opened at Verulam police station after three children sustained burns inside the house.
“One died at the Jacaranda Avenue house in Mountview and the others were taken to hospital,” said Zwane.

Reaction Unit SA (Rusa) spokesperson Prem Balram said they responded to the scene after receiving multiple calls from residents in the area, reporting the entrapment of three children.
“Reaction officers found Melokuhle face down and burnt beyond recognition. Two other children were found outside the residence. 
“Paramedics treated them for burns to the body and face, then took them to hospital,” he said.

Relatives yesterday went to fetch Nondumiso in uMgababa, where she lived with her daughter. They found her sitting on a blanket on the floor next to another blanket with her child’s clothes laid out. She said she was in shock and had nothing to say.
Melokuhle’s aunt, Zama Mbuyisa, expressed anger at the death of her niece.
A neighbour described Melokuhle as a very pleasant, shy little girl.

“She was very pretty, chubby, pleasant, quiet and shy,” she said.
