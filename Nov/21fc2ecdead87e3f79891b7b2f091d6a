Durban - Remember earlier this year, the petrol price just kept climbing and climbing? Well, if you have not heard,motorists are likely to enjoy a substantial reduction in the price of fuel in time for the Christmas travel season.

This is according to the unaudited month-end fuel price data released by the Central Energy Fund, which would see the fuel price return to levels last seen around the middle of the year. 

“The good news is a likely R1.85 reduction per litre in the price of petrol, with diesel coming down by an estimated R1.40, and illuminating paraffin dropping by R1.28,” said AA spokesperson Layton Beard.
He highlighted the impact of international petroleum pricing and the rand/US dollar exchange rate on the fuel price.
“The outlook for fuel pricing into 2019 remains cloudy, but we are hopeful that some stability will return,” he said. 

So if you were planning that long drive out of the city and into the countryside for the festive season, your plans can stay as is!
