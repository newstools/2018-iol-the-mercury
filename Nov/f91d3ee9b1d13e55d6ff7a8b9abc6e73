Durban - uMhlanga Rocks restaurant, Old Town Italy, is gathering reports from patrons following an apparent salmonella outbreak this week. 
On their Facebook page, the eatery’s management denied reports that the issue had been going for a few months. 

They wrote; “We have outlined the facts below and if you have any concerns please do not hesitate to contact us. We will be posting updates as new information comes to light so please keep checking back.
• On Saturday 6 October 2018 we had two reported incidents that were investigated, action was taken and independent tests done. Immediate action was taken as per our health and safety guidelines to investigate the issue through a variety of independent tests, as well as a number of measures in our restaurant. 
• No further incidents were reported until this week. 

• On 20 October the test results came back and showed that there was no presence of Salmonella in our kitchen/personnel tested or on the ingredients tested including the eggs and hollandaise sauce.
• No further incidents were reported until the 5th of November.
• We therefore viewed the two cases as isolated. Despite this we took additional precautionary measures, in addition to our normal health and safety procedures.”

Management said on Monday, they received 11 reports of patrons getting sick and have been engaging with them. 
“After the release of our public statement we have been receiving additional reports and are in the process of gathering all the relevant information. Our thoughts and prayers are with all those affected,” management said.
