Durban - A 37-year-old man has appeared in the Umzumbe Magistrate's Court on the KwaZulu-Natal south coast after he allegedly shot his wife in Hibberdene last week. The woman succumbed to her injuries.
Gary Govender claimed that his wife, Mantombi Pearl Govender, 39, had been shot by two unknown men last week. At the time, they were standing outside Leisuredene Village in Hibberdene. 

However, in a turn of events, Govender was arrested in connection with his wife's murder. 
He appeared in court on Monday. The matter was postponed and he was remanded in police custody. He is due back in court next week where he is expected to make his formal bail application. 
Meanwhile, a worker was rushed to hospital after he sustained a fractured pelvis and femur when a wall collapsed on him at a construction site in KwaMashu, north of Durban. 

Netcare 911 spokesperson, Shawn Herbst, said the worker was treated on scene before being rushed to a hospital for further care.
