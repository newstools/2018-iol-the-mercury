Durban - The Salvation Army has called for an end to the silence, stigma and shame that has entrenched violence against women and children.
On the eve of the start of the 16 days of activism to end violence against women and children on November 25, the organisation would like to emphasise the importance of this annual commemoration in a country in which, according to the World Health Organisation, the femicide rate in 2015 was almost five times higher than the global average of 2.6. 

The organisation's public relations secretary, Major Carin Holmes, said The Salvation Army endorsed the hashtag #HearMeToo as a way of bringing to the forefront the voice of women and girls who have survived violence, and who are defending women’s rights every day.
"It is shocking that in 2017/18, there were 79578 reported rape cases, 13028 reported cases of sexual assault, and that 985 children were murdered in South Africa. This doesn’t take into account incidents that were not reported," Holmes said. 
Holme said the way we treat each other as parents often dictates the way our children will treat significant others in their lives.

The Salvation Army has a number of social initiatives that assist victims of crime, including child and youth care centres and shelters for women.
"We also call on South Africans to remember those people living with or impacted by HIV/Aids on World Aids Day, December 1. In particular, we remember households where young people are forced to take on parenting roles due to the deaths of their parents through HIV/Aids. This robs them of their childhood and teenage years by placing enormous burdens of parenting on their shoulders," Holmes said.
