Durban - The ride-hailing service Taxify has officially launched operations in the streets of Pietermaritzburg.
The e-hailing service said it had launched operations after receiving requests from passengers and drivers alike.  
Gareth Taylor, Taxify’s country manager for the South African region, said: “After our successful launches in South Africa’s main centres, expanding to Pietermaritzburg is a natural next step for Taxify. Taxify is an affordable alternative for anyone seeking convenient, on-demand transport from A to B. We also pride ourselves on paying drivers using the platform a greater percentage of the fare than other similar services do,” he said. 
Taxify said they had been successful in all the South African cities they had launched in since they arrived in the country two years ago. 
They said they were looking forward to offering convenience, cost-effective, quick and reliable rides to people in the city. 
Sne Nene said: “I’ve used Taxify in Johannesburg and Durban when I’ve travelled there… I’m so glad that it has come to Pietermaritzburg too - it’s great to have a choice.”
Taxify will compete with Uber and the local e-hailing service, Tag Your Ride. 
Tag Your Ride was launched in November last year by UKZN’s academic development officer, Rogerant Tshibangu, who became the first e-hailing service to operate in the provincial capital.
