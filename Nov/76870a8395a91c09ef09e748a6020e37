Beyoncé and Jay-Z have finally arrived in Mzansi ahead of the highly-anticipated Global Citizen Festival SA.

 

 The power couple and their three children were spotted at Lanseria airport on Thursday, November 29.

 

 Though it seems the Carters were trying hard to make their SA arrival low key, as Jay-Z is seen in a black hoodie trying to hide one of the twins, while Bey was trying to hide away in an umbrella but fans spotted them and went into a frenzy.
