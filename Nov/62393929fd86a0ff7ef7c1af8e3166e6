Durban - Eskom has warned that the country’s power system remains vulnerable, which could lead to a low probability of loadshedding for the remainder of the week. 
Eskom has said they will continue to use open-cycle gas turbines and emergency reserves to limit loadshedding. 

“Some power generating units are projected to return to service later in the week.  We will keep our customers informed if there are any changes to the system,” Eskom said. 
On Monday, employees at the Optimum Coal Mine staged a protest against their employee following wage demands. 
According to reports, staff had not been paid for November. 

The workers had blockaded the road leading to the Hendrina power station, and also the entrance of the Optimum Coal Mine. Hendrina is one of the 10 power stations with less than 20 days of coal stockpiles at its coal stockyard. Any protracted disturbances could have detrimental impact on the power station.
Eskom has said they have teams who are working on a recovery plan which will see an improvement in generation and operational performance while also stabilising the system.
“We encourage residents and businesses to please use electricity sparingly to ease the demand for electricity. Please switch off geysers as well as all non-essential lighting and electricity appliances to assist in reducing demand,” Eskom said.
