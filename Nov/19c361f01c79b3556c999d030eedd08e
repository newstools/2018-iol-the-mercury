Durban - Durbanites have reacted to the passing of human rights and religious activist, Paddy Kearney, with shock and sadness.

“He was Chair and Founder of the Denis Hurley Centre, Founding Director of Diakonia Council of Churches, Chair of the Gandhi Development Trust and advisor to KZN Christian Council, among many other important positions.

On social media, many celebrated the life of Kearney. 
Danny Chetty, wrote on Facebook: “Blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of God. Paddy Kearney, a humble gentle giant has taken his final breath. His life and labor's passion and solidarity, shaped our struggle and helped us overcome at all costs. Founder of Diakonia, and leader of the ecumenical movement, Paddy carved his space without fear or favour, seeking only to serve”.

Kurt Holmes wrote: “It is a sad day for the Ecumenical Community of Durban today with the sudden passing of Paddy Kearney. I was privileged to be with Paddy at his book launch just 2 weeks ago. We sat and spoke and I mentioned to him that I regarded him as an icon here in Durban”.

Satish Dupelia said: “The world has lost a wonderful, peaceful and gentle soul in Uncle Paddy Kearney. He was an activist of note,an apartheid era struggle hero, a shining example of a good human in every possible way, and there is so much more to say about this gentle giant who has left this world”.
