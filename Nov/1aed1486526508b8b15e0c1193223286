Durban - The Annual Garden of the Year Competition run by Durban and Coast Horticultural Society (DCHS) has this year seen almost a complete clean sweep by gardens in the areas from Westville to Forest Hills.
The title of Garden of the Year 2018 belongs to Danna Flack in Kloof, who also won first prize in Best Large Garden, Best First Time Entrant, and joint first prize for Lawn with Manorfields Country Estate in Hillcrest.

 


Manorfields also took the honours in Large Common Complex Property, with joint second being Le Domaine in Hillcrest and Doone Village in Pinetown. Turrea in Westville won Small Common Complex Property. 
Second prize in the Large Garden category went to another exceptional garden - that of Helen Cannon in Westville. The prize for Large Complex Garden was awarded to Geoff and Ann Maud in Hillcrest, who also won third in Entertainment Area. Ray and Cheryl Walker of Assegay won the prize for Small Complex Garden. 

The best entertainment area was adjudged to be that of Debbie Burke of Mount Edgecombe, with Janice Draper of Cowies Hill second and the Mauds third.
The lovely property of David James in Westville, with a stream and cliff face at the bottom of it and filled with indigenous trees, shrubs and plants, was a worthy winner of the Indigenous Garden award. 

 


President of DCHS, Leslie Noble, said it was wonderful to see gardens with such immediate impact. 
"The winning one literally took the judges’ breath away. Then, we had such difficulty in deciding between some of them, in spite of mark sheets, that some joint prizes had to be issued. It is a pity, though, that entries from smaller properties, particularly nearer the coast, have fallen off. We hope these will revive next year," she said.
