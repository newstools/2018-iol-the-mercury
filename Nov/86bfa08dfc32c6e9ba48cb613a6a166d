Cape Town - There was excitement and determination in the air as hundreds made their way to the Game store in Canal Walk when it opened at midnight for Black Friday. 

 Queues could be seen spilling out of the Canal Walk shopping centre in Cape Town and shoppers' trolleys were filled to the brim as they took advantage of the sales.

 

 Before opening the doors, Game store manager Nizaam Dramat gave shoppers a few ground rules and what to expect. Meanwhile, inside the store, cashiers were dancing and feeling the spirit of Black Friday.

 

 Black Friday is known to be the biggest sale of the year, with prices of groceries, appliances and clothing slashed to low prices.

 

 It originally started in the US to mark the start of Thanksgiving and the Christmas shopping season. Now, retailers around the world now use 'Black Friday' as an opportunity to get more sales in stores and online shops.
