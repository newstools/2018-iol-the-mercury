Durban - The Democratic Alliance in KwaZulu-Natal has called for an urgent meeting with Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) CEO, Sibusiso Sithole, following from an oversight visit inspection at the Isipingo and Berea train stations this week. 
The visit, which was headed up by the DA's Zwakele Mncwango, saw members interacting with commuters. 

Mncwango said they were concerned about the issued raised by commuters about the delays in the train schedules, absence of security guards in coaches and the inconsistencies in service delivery. 
Late trains have hit people oppressed by poverty the hardest as some have lost their jobs, while some have been served with warnings for arriving late at work," Mncwango said. 
He said commuters told the delegation that monthly travel coupons have been discontinued with only daily and weekly tickets being sold. 

"This means that consumers have to spend more on transport, further constraining their ability to make ends meet in a struggling economy," Mncwango said.
