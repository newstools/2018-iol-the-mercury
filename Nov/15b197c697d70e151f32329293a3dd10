Durban - A new bridge linking KwaZulu-Natal and Mozambique will create jobs and boost trade between the countries, said KZN's Economic Development MEC Sihle Zikalala. 

 

 Zikalala launched the new bridge on Saturday, and said the government was advancing African integration. 

 

 “This bridge will boost the countries’ economy and create more jobs as it will enhance trade opportunities which will make it easier for exports and imports and imports between among the two counties,” said Zikalala. 

 

 The bridge will see the travel time between Maputo to Kosi Bay reduced from six hours to 90 minutes. 
 Zikalala added that the bridge will boost trade and tourism between South Africa and Mozambique. 

 


 
 


 

 "The more trade increases in a country the more jobs it creates and therefore this bridge will create a lot more jobs and make in
  easier for exports and imports between South Africa and Mozambique, " said Zikalala.

 

 Zikalala said that when South Africa joined more than 50 African states in signing the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCTFA) agreement, which is aimed at facilitating a single market for goods and services on the continent, this is one of the things that the 
 agreement aimed at achieving.
