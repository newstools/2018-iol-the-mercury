Randfontein - Four people, including a well-known former soccer player, have been arrested following the discovery of a clandestine drug laboratory on a smallholding in Randfontein.

 

 The four were arrested following an investigation by a multi-disciplinary team made up of crime intelligence, the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (Hawks) and Gauteng Province Anti-Gang Unit members.

 

 The soccer legend, whose identity is known to IOL, played for Kaizer Chiefs and Moroka Swallows in his heyday. He cannot be named as he has not appeared in court.

 

 Police spokesperson Colonel Brenda Muridili explained the events leading to the four's arrest. 

 

 
  "The multi-disciplinary team observed the small holding for a period of time until they were satisfied that they had enough evidence to apply for a search warrant. 
 
 
  
 
 
  "The search warrant was effected in the early hours of this morning and the Team discovered a steel shed full of chemicals and machines used to manufacture Mandrax as well as a truck containing liquid chemicals.

 Lieutenant General Stefan Schutte 
 commended the team on the arrests.

 

 “Drugs ravage our communities and destroy the future of our children. As we will soon commemorate the 16 Days of Activism Against Women and Children, we all need to take extra care of our children by ridding our communities of drugs”, he said. 

 

 The four will appear in the Randfontein Magistrates' Court where they will face a charge of manufacturing drugs
