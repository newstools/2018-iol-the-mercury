Durban - Pedestrians and motorists are urged to heed road safety rules as the bridge over the N2 linking uMhlanga New Town and Cornubia partially opens this week. 
The bridge is a crucial section of a new route in the city’s integrated public transport network, GO!Durban and will run from uMhlanga New Town to Bridge City, KwaMashu.

Single lanes in both directions (east and west), which are essentially a continuation of uMhlanga Ridge Boulevard will be open to traffic from Wednesday, November 28.
The broad bridge accommodates two dedicated bus rapid transport (BRT) lanes in the centre and two lanes in each direction for motorist access. 
According to city’s Head of Transport Authority, Thami Manyathi, pedestrians should be mindful of road safety rules around this area because of its close proximity to the informal settlement of Blackburn and the large Cornubia housing estate.

“We are seeing pedestrians not using the walkways provided for them, as well as crossing the national N2 with vehicles and trucks travelling at high speed, and are most concerned about their safety, as well as the repercussions for road users should an accident occur,” said Manyathi.
“We appeal to pedestrians in the area to be aware that motorists will now be using the bridge and off-ramp and that there will be active construction vehicles on the boulevard and the off-ramps as construction on the new route continues. Pedestrian sidewalks across the bridge and along the Blackburn off-ramp have been constructed and we implore the community to please use those, for their own safety,” said Manyathi.
The bridge is a crucial link in the Corridor 9 (C9) route which will eventually link uMhlanga via Cornubia and Phoenix Industrial to Bridge City in KwaMashu. The economic spin offs as result of this development, are promising to be considerable and much needed job opportunities are also expected to be created.
