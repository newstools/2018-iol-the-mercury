Durban - After weeks of being on the run, a 49-year-old woman was arrested following the murder of a 18-year-old in Newark, on the KwaZulu-Natal north coast.
Earlier this year, the accused, Thandiwe Nomusa Masinga is alleged to have gone to the home of Lungisani Buthelezi where she and a group of people assaulted the teenager. 

According to police spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbele, Buthelezi was assaulted and died. Another person, aged 20, was also assaulted but managed to flee. 
“A case of murder, attempted murder and kidnapping was opened at Newark police station for investigation. Police worked around the clock to find the suspects. Four males aged between 19 and 43 were arrested two months ago and taken to court where they were remanded in custody,” Mbele said. 
She said police investigations continued and it led to the arrest of Masinga who had fled the area. 

“The accused had suspected the victims of committing crimes in the area but no cases against the victims could be found. Acts of vigilantism will not be tolerated in this province and people are urged to report criminal activities to the police who will investigate and arrest the suspects,” Mbele said.
