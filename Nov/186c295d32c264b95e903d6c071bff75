Durban - Sometimes even the best laid plans go awry, as was the case for a Verulam mom whose baby had to be delivered at the side of the road - in an ambulance - this week.
Crisis Medical received a call from one of their own, Glen Padayachee, who said his daughter was in active labour. 

“He said his daughter needed urged assistance and transport to the hospital,” said Crisis Medical spokesperson, Kyle van Reenen. 
He said the team rushed to assist along with Emergency Care Practitioner, Paige Fitchat. 
“Upon arrival,they found the young lady in the advanced stage of childbirth. A decision was made to load her into the emergency service vehicle and transport her to nearby Osindisweni State Hospital where her Obstetrician was located,” he said. 

However little did the team know that baby Padayachee had other plans and was not going to wait until her mommy arrived at the hospital. As contractions drew closer a decision was made to assist mom in delivering her baby in the ambulance under Fitchat’s care.

 


The infant was delivered a short while later and both mom and baby were transported to Osindisweni Hospital for further care.
