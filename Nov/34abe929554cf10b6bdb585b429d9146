Durban - THE case relating to the murder of 9-year-old Sadia Sukhraj has been moved to the Durban High Court where 33 witnesses are expected to testify for the State. 

 

 Among the witnesses will be Sadia’s father, Shailendra Sukhraj, Shallcross community members, medical practitioners and
  police investigators. 

 

 At the Durban Magistrate’s Court  on Thursday, prosecutor Sipho  Mhlongo read the indictment into the record before handing it to Magistrate Vanita Armoo
 .

 

 Sibonelo Mkhize, 35, is the accused in the matter. He faces charges of robbery with aggravating circumstances and two counts of murder, which led to the death of Sadia and his alleged accomplice, Siyabonga Bulose
 .

 

 According to the summary of substantial facts, Sadia’s father drove her to her grandparents’ home on Himalaya Drive, Shallcross, on May 28, en route to school. He parked in the driveway and alighted from his grey Hyundai vehicle. Sadia, pictured, was still seated at the back of the car. 

 

 Mkhize and his accomplice, armed with guns, accosted Sadia and Sukhraj. 
 They demanded the car keys from Sukhraj, who threw them at the accused, who  then
  got into the car. 

 

 While fleeing, Sukhraj fired several gunshots at the driver. 
 The vehicle came to a standstill at a nearby park. Bulose
  was shot dead, while Mkhize fled on foot.

 

 However, an off-duty policeman  pursued and apprehended him. 
 Sadia, who was also shot, was taken to hospital where she later died. 

 

 Mhlongo said that the accused acted in the furtherance of a common purpose, which was to commit the crimes set out in the indictment. 

 Mkhize is due to appear before the High Court on November 19.
