Durban - Today marks 8 years since Anni Dewani was murdered while on honeymoon in South Africa. 
Her father Vinod Hindocha said the entire family and few friends will go to the beach where her ashes are scattered and say a prayer. 

The family created a video to honour their daughter's memory saying its 8 years since you left us, we love you and miss you. 
The Swedish beauty would have celebrated her 36th birthday. 
She was shot and killed on November 13, 2010, during an apparent hijacking in Gugulethu, Cape Town, in 2010.

Last year the family also held at prayer on a beach in Sweden.
Her father Vinod Hindocha said the pain of losing his daughter was unbearable. 

Her mother, Nilam, was diagnosed with cancer, while her father’s right arm was severed in 2015, while carrying out repairs on a lift.
Xolile Mngeni was jailed for life in 2012, and died two years later from a brain tumour.
Taxi driver Zola Tongo was jailed for 18 years and Mziwamadoda Qwabe received 25 years.

In August according to Mail Online, Dewani has been dating Brazilian photographer  Gledison Lopez Martins and the couple has enjoyed a number of overseas holidays.
Anni's uncle Ashok said while articles of Shrien Dewani with his new love interest came as a shock, it was also a confirmation.
