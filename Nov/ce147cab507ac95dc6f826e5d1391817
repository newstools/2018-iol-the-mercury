Durban - ETHEKWINI city manager Sipho Nzuza has ordered an investigation into the number of parties that Durban Tourism will be pumping money into this December, following controversy with rapper Cassper Nyovest’s Fill Up Moses Mabhida concert next Saturday.
Nzuza wants officials in the internal audit unit to strengthen the selection process for events funded by the eThekwini Municipality and Durban Tourism.

Speaking to the Sunday Tribune from Morocco, where he is on official business, Nzuza said he was unaware of the concert until recently when he received complaints over the city’s spending.
Said Nzuza: “I have requested auditors to look at the processes in selecting event organisers and to improve controls. The stadium is owned by the municipality; even if we give it out for free, there should be some sort of return.”
He said although there is a proposal for the event, funding for it had not been approved.

Deputy city manager for economic development and planning Phillip Sithole said his team selected events based on the promotion of social cohesion, whether they would attract visitors, market the city, promote tourism, grow the local economy, promote local talent, create business opportunities for locals and create jobs.
Sithole said, if approved, the city would spend about R2m for Cassper’s concert and generate income by selling food and beverages.
