Durban  - To cushion South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) grant beneficiaries from the December rush, which results in long queues, the December payment cycle was brought forward to begin on November 28.
Sassa spokesperson Paseka Letsatsi said this applied to beneficiaries who collected their money from ATMs and stores. 

He said those who received their money from cash vans and community halls in cash would be paid from December 3 to 14.
“Cash payments are done on different days in different pay points on a staggered basis,” said Letsatsi.
He warned that the early payment was not a bonus or double payment.

“If a beneficiary collects the December payment between November 28 and the end of December, he or she will only get the next payment in January,” he said.
Julie Smith, a researcher for the Pietermaritzburg Economic Justice and Dignity Group, said the rationale behind the early payment was sound, but it had a negative financial implication because the grant amount was so low.
Meanwhile, social justice organisation the Black Sash has warned grant recipients to swop to the new Sassa gold card by December 15.

“This is extremely important as beneficiaries will not be able to gain access to their grants in January next year using the old white Sassa cards, which expire in December,” said a Black Sash spokesperson.
