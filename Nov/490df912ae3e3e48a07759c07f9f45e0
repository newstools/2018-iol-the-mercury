Durban - ANC branches in the Moses Mabhida region, the party’s second-largest in KwaZulu-Natal, have threatened to take the party to court if it doesn’t convene the region’s elective conference.
The region has been without leadership and the party recently installed a task team to run the party’s affairs in the region. 

However, some of the branches in the region are not happy with the interim leadership structure, which they claim is not representative of all the branches’ factions.
Members claiming to be from 78 of the 89 branches in the region staged a sit-in at the party’s regional office in Pietermaritzburg at the weekend and have vowed to intensify their protest. 
Sithembiso Nkuna, a branch leader and spokesperson for the disgruntled branches, said the branches regarded the task team as an illegitimate structure and felt there was unnecessary reluctance to convene a conference.

“A conference may be convened if at least a third of the branches request it,” he said. 
The branches had written to the provincial executive committee indicating their intention to go to court if the matter was not resolved. 
“They responded that they would oppose such action,” Nkuna said.

 The disgruntled branches are even threatening not to campaign for the ANC before the general elections next year. Nkuna said the branches “will find it very difficult to take command from the illegitimate task team”.
ANC KZN spokesperson Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu said the party’s national executive committee had decided that no provincial and regional conferences would be convened until after next year’s elections, so it was unfair to blame the provincial leadership for the delay in holding the conference.
