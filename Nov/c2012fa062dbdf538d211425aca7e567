Durban - It’s November and we are still feeling the wintery chill. While we are frowning at this kind of weather, South African Weather Services forecaster, Wisani Maluleke, believes the cooler weather temperatures are ‘normal’.
According to Maluleke, there is nothing strange about the weather. 

“Weather patterns will not necessarily be the same around the same time each year. When it comes to the Summer months, there is no guarantee that we will have the same weather patterns. Every year is different,” he said. 
He said recently, the region dealt with a major cold front and the cooler weather conditions are just a ripple effect from that. 
Maluleke said even though we are in for some warmer days ahead, we cannot rule out a few colder days in between. 

“We have noticed that last week, there were cooler days between the more warmer days,” he said. 
Meanwhile, no rain has been forecast for Thursday and Friday. 
On Thursday, most parts of the province will experience partly cloudy conditions in the early morning. Some areas will also experience fog early in the morning. 

Winds speeds are expected to hover between 9 and 19km/h
On Friday, clear skies have been predicted for most of the day, changing to partly cloudy conditions later towards the evening. Winds are expected to reach up to 19km/h.
