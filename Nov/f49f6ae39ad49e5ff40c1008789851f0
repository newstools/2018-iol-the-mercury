Durban - The SA Post Office has cleared the backlog in its depots that affected the delivery of items to customers, the state-owned entity said this week.
“We worked tirelessly to resolve the factors causing the processing backlog. It is pleasing to report that these issues have now been addressed and the backlog is resolved,” chief executive Mark Barnes said.

Depots at the Post Office, whose present inflows of items have peaked at 2.8million items daily, accumulated processing backlogs due to a month-long nationwide strike, which was resolved in July, as well as the withdrawal of transport services by suppliers over late payments.
Yesterday it said delivery fleets had been restored and the utility had benefited from a capital allocation of R2.9billion to fund its operations and settle amounts owed to suppliers.
“The processing of international mail has improved and the articles that are behind delivery schedules have reduced notably,” Barnes said.
