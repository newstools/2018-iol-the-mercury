"She appeared at Randburg Court and her case was [also] postponed to the November 8th for an extradition enquiry," said Cele.
"Arrests of this nature serve as a warning to all other people who commit crimes and seek refuge in our country. South Africa is not a safe heaven for criminals."
A Danish police officer was present as Cele addressed media in Pretoria.

According to the Copenhagen Post, Nielsen swindled the Danish government out of 111 million Krone over a 16-year period. 
She is also reportedly being investigated for suspicious transactions going back as far as 1997. Nielsen worked at the Socialstyrelsen (National Board of Social Services) social authority for 40 years.
