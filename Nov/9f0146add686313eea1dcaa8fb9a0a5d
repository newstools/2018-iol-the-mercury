Durban - While rumours swirled around that Michelle Obama or Oprah Winfrey could be spotted in Durban in March, organisers of the Forbes 
 Leading Women Summit remained mum on just who the big names would be at the international summit to be held for the first time in the city.

 

 At the launch on Friday, Roberta Naicker, managing director of African Business News, to which brand Forbes Africa belongs, announced it would be held on March 8 at the Durban ICC. 

 

 I
 n its fourth year, the summit gathers women from around the globe who are leaders in their field across all sectors. 
 The summit was formerly by invitation-only, but next year will see 400 invited delegates and a limited 100 tickets for purchase. 

 

 Naicker, who grew up in Phoenix, Durban, but who is now based in Johannesburg, said some well-known international women would attend, but she would not confirm any names, saying the summit’s key goal was to drive women empowerment issues.

 

 
  
  
   Sihle Zikalala, the MEC for Economic, Tourism and Environment Affairs Sihle Zikalala has welcomed the decision by Forbes Africa to host the first Africa Forbes Women Leading Women Summit in KZN. Picture Leon Lestrade / African News Agency. ( ANA ).
  
 

 Speaking to the Independent on Saturday on the sidelines of the launch, she said: “I have always been passionate about women’s empowerment, especially on our continent. 

 

 “I believe, in Africa, we can start to change the narrative and, while we have a long way to go, it’s events such as this which provide a platform.”   

 

 Economic Development MEC Sihle Zikalala said women's potential had been historically undermined and that they should be given the land because they worked it.
