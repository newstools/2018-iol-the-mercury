Durban - Hours after scattering his father’s ashes in the Tugela River and sharing a drink with friends, Durban businessman Arnold Watkins was killed in a home invasion on Monday night.
It is believed he was shot with his own firearm after a scuffle with the robbers.

Watkins, 57, was the owner of Skyton Recycling in Mandeni, north of Durban. 
His long-time friend André van Rooyen said he spent the day with Watkins at the Tugela River and last spoke to him at around 9.30pm. 
“He asked me and a few others to be there when he scattered his father’s ashes. He said it was a difficult thing for him to do. His father died about a year ago, but Monday was his father’s birthday and he thought it was appropriate to do it then,” Van Rooyen said.

He said they shared a drink and at around 6pm parted ways. Later that night, Watkins sent messages to his friends, thanking them for being there. 
According to police, the incident occurred half an hour later, at 10pm. 
Police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said Watkins sustained a gunshot wound to the stomach. 

“A case of murder was opened at Mandeni police station for investigation. At this stage, we cannot confirm that he was shot with his own firearm,” she said.
Van Rooyen said he believed Watkins’s own firearm was used to kill him as the holster was found near him, but the firearm was missing. 
He described his friend as “a charitable man who often helped people, employed locals in his business and was involved in community projects. 

“We have been friends since school and he was one of the best people I’ve known,” he said.
