Durban - A 35-year-old waitress has lost her life after the car she was travelling in veered off the road and crashed into a tree along Watson Highway, oThongathi on Friday. 
The waitress was travelling towards oThongathi in a private meter-taxi with a colleague when the incident happened. Paul Herbst of IPSS medical rescue said three people were in the vehicle when it crashed. Herbst said one person died on the scene. He said two others were critically injured. 

The mangled wreckage of the Toyota Etios greeted emergency services and paramedics. The car was on its roof along Watson Highway. 
"The Fire and emergency department had to use the jaws of life to get access to the two injured entrapped patients. The cause of the crash will be investigated by police." Herbst said.
