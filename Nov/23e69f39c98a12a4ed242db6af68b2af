Durban - Construction workers in Durban got a fright when they arrived at work on Monday morning and found a green mamba snake wrapped around a scaffolding. 
 
  
 
 
  Durban snake catcher Nick Evans said he received a call at around 8 am to remove the snake from the 5th floor of a building construction site near Sibaya on the M4. 
 
 
  
 
 
  "At first I didn't believe it was a green mamba because everyone calls a green snake a green mamba, but when I arrived at the construction site it was actually an adult green mamba."
 
 
  
 
 
  Evans said the snake which is highly venomous was found in the coastal areas. 
 
 
  
 
 
  He said this snake was not aggressive. 
 
 
  
 
 
  "The green mamba and black mambas are known for being highly aggressive but this is exaggerated. Green mambas usually curl themselves on trees. 
 
 
  
 
 
  "The snake was relaxed and I removed it."
 
 
  
 
 
  Evans said the 1,5-metre snake would be released back into nature.
