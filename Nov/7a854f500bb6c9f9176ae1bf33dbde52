Durban - Katie Friedman believes that residents who continue to give money, clothing and food to children on the street are simply enabling child slavery. 
 

 Recently, Friedman who has been living in Durban for the last two years, took to social media to plead with residents to rather give to charities established to assist street children instead of handing over money to the children who stand and beg on the street. 

 

 
  
 
 

 

 Friedman, who previously lived in London, said she was horrified when she noticed the trend of people giving to youngsters, begging at traffic intersections. 

 

 "My issue was also that people would post on Facebook community groups and blame the eThekwini Municipality of local government instead of understanding that they need to take responsibility. This is our problem," she said. 

 

 She said there is only so much that the city and local government departments could do but by people continuing to give to child beggars, they were enabling them to remain on the street. 

 

 "I put up my post to create awareness and to get people to realise that what they were doing was wrong. There are so many well-run organisations that assist these children and we should be giving to them instead. There is i-Care, the Denis Hurley Centre and lots more where residents can donate. Those centres are there to help these children get off the streets and live a better life," Friedman said. 

 

 She added that the post has generated a lot of comments, mainly positive, with people agreeing with her. 

 

 "I understand that people want to help but we must learn to do so more responsibly. Rather give to registered charities," Friedman said.
