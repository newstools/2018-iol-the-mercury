Durban - The official opening of the 20th Durban Diwali Festival took place on Saturday evening at the old Drive-in site where hundreds of locals gathered. 
 
 
  
 
 
  Among the guests were IFP leader Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi and businessman Vivian Reddy. 
 
 
  
 
 
  The president of the South African Hindu Maha Sabha, Ashwin Trikamjee, welcomed guests, with a special thanks to Buthelezi, who graced the first Diwali Festival at the Bay of Plenty two decades ago. 
 
 
  
 
 
  "He was here 20 years ago and is here 20 years later," said Trikamjee to applause.
 
 
  
 
 
  "The 20th year occassion has come so quickly. I can remember in 1998 when we planned this festival. Many said it won't work. But we took the plunge at the Durban Bay of Plenty and thousands turned up."
 
 
  
 
 
  Trikamjee said they moved onto bigger premises over the years, including the Blue Lagoon, until they settled at the Drive-in site a few years ago. 
 
 
  
 
 
  He said the festival did not only serve the Hindu community alone, but it had become an attraction for all South Africans.
 
 
  
 
 
  "This is social cohesion right on the ground."
 
 
  
 
 
  The chairperson of the CLR Commission, Thoko Mkhwanazi-Xaluva, said she hoped peace, tolerance and friendship united the country, adding "let the hate go away".
 
 
  
 
 
  "Don't entertain hate speech and hatred. If we entertain it, we will remain in the dark."
 
 
  
 
 
  Buthelezi, decked in eastern attire, rounded up proceedings, saying he felt a deep connection with the sabha. 
 
 
  
 
 
  "The sabha has had a long journey in South Africa. It was founded in the same year that my uncle Pixley Ka Seme founded the ANC." 
 
 
  
 
 
  He spoke about the importance of social cohesion and holding hands "across racial divides".
