Durban - A man who raped a woman on a tombstone in a graveyard was jailed for life in the Durban Regional Court on Wednesday. 
 

 Reggie Dlamini, 34, was found guilty of 2 counts of rape, robbery and possession of a dangerous weapon. 

 

 He was acquitted on charges of kidnapping. 

 

 The court heard that in December 2017, Dlamini had given the 52-year-old victim a lift. 

 

 Instead of taking the woman to her desired destination, he detoured and drove to the Stellawood Cemetery in Umbilo where he raped the woman in the back of his van. 

 

 He realised that cars were driving past and took the woman to a tombstone where he raped her again. 

 

 Magistrate Anand Maharaj found that Dlamini committed a despicable act in multiple counts of rape, violated the victim's right to dignity and privacy in the most perverse of ways. 

 

 He did not find any compelling or substantial evidence to deviate from the prescribed life sentence.
