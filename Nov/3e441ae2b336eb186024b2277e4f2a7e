Durban - Deputy Mayor Fawzia Peer thanks SAFREF for donating R400 000 fully equipped science laboratory to Mafumbuka High School in C Section, uMlazi last month.   Deputy Mayor Fawzia Peer was speaking at the launch of the science laboratory.
 “These labs will connect our children through a lifeline of education which will aid in improving the quality of science knowledge once learners embark on tertiary education.    “This handover came at the right time, when we as government together with our corporate and global partners are engaging on the importance of Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM) in schools,” said Peer.

 This is the 20th laboratory that the South African Petroleum Refineries (SAPREF), has established in schools around the South Durban basin area.
 SAPREF’s Sustainable Development Officer Mpume Mbambo said the company has identified communities situated near its plant and is committed to making a difference by supporting sustainable projects.
 She said SAPREF’s biggest portion of their social investment budget is spent on education.   Principal of Mafumbuka High School, Cyril Ngcobo said he was humbled by the donation made by SAFREF.    “This is a dream come true for learners, educators and the community.”   Grade 12 learner Philani Ndlovu who plans to study medicine next year said he is thrilled to be able to utilise the laboratory which will give him practical application to technical science.
