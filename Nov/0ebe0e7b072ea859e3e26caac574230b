Durban - The MSC Musica sailed into Durban waters early on Wednesday morning. For the majestic cruiseliner built in 2006, it was the first time that it had docked in African waters. 
According to MSC,  life aboard is beautiful from the moment you step on board; from the central foyer’s three-tier waterfall to its see-through piano, floating suspended on a crystal floor above a pool of shimmering water. The designer venues on board are equally inspiring, whether you’re dancing to a band in the dazzling Crystal Lounge, pausing in the stylish Havana Club cigar lounge, treating yourself to a wine tasting, gaming in the Sanremo Casino or sitting back to a superb live show in the stunning La Scala Theatre.

MSC Musica not only launched a new class of ecological cruise ship, she launched a new class of cruise - a spacious world of graceful lines and superlative choice, enriched by the creativity, fine natural materials and attention to detail that have always distinguished MSC Cruises.
The cruiseliner has 1,268 passenger cabins which can accommodate 2,550 passengers double occupancy, served by approximately 990 crew members.
The Musica will play host to the 162nd Gala Dinner of the Durban Chamber of Commerce and Industry on Wednesday.
