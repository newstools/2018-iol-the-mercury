Durban - A local businessman, who manages a fleet of Uber drivers, said more needs to be done to raise awareness about the dangers of being an Uber driver. 
In recent months, there have been a spate of attacks on Uber and Taxify drivers. 

On Tuesday night, an Uber driver was shot dead and a passenger seriously wounded after armed men opened fire of the vehicle that they were in, parked in the Musgrave area. 
It is alleged that the men approached the vehicle, parked at the side of the road and began shooting.
Provincial police spokesperson, Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane, said a case of murder and attempted murder has been opened at the Berea police station.

The man, who asked not to be named, said earlier this week one of his drivers was attacked. 
“Just on Monday, one of my drivers was hijacked. This happened in Folweni, near uMlazi. The driver’s hands and feet were bound and he was left in an abandoned building. Fortunately, someone walking near the building heard him shouting for help and came to his rescue. He was then able to contact me. 
The vehicle was recovered an hour later by the tracking company. It was stripped for parts,” the man said. 

Last month, a Taxify driver was hijacked in Cato Manor. The vehicle was later recovered. The driver was unharmed.
