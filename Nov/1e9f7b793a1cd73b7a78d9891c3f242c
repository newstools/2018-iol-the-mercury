Durban - The KwaZulu-Natal Department of Social Development says there has been an increase in violence against children under the age of 12.
This comes as the country shines a spotlight on violence against women and children during the 16 Days of Activism campaign, which has the theme #HearMeToo.

Ncumisa Ndelu, spokesperson for Social Development MEC Weziwe Thusi, said: “It’s difficult to say, as most cases remain unreported, but we have noted an increase in violence, particularly against children under the age of 12.”
The operations manager of Childline KZN, Adeshini Naicker, said that according to the latest police crime statistics, violence against women and children had increased by 11% over the past two years.
“The president, in his address at the recent presidential summit on gender-based violence in Pretoria, acknowledged that South African statistics were almost five times higher than the global average,” she said. 

Ndelu urged communities to partner with the department to tackle gender-based violence.
“The department has worked with various communities to encourage involvement in the protection of women and children and is looking at establishing street committees,” she said.
She added that the department also offered services to help rehabilitate abusers. She also said prevention and awareness programmes were being implemented in all wards and local municipalities targeting the vulnerable groups.

She said that a call centre - linked to the national Gender-Based Violence Command Centre - would be launched, to cater for all queries addressed to the department.
“This will be managed by qualified social workers,” said Ndelu.
