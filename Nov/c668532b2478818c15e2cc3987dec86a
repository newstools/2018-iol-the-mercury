Durban -- A rural KwaZulu-Natal primary school has been awarded the Innovation and Student’s Choice Award for Water Explorer 2018 at a gathering of students from 10 other countries, in London.
Ebomvini Primary, from  Izingolweni, inland of Port Shepstone, represented South Africa at the event where participants from countries afar field as Turkey, Germany and Malta, celebrated their water saving achievements.
“I am speechless!” exclaimed the delighted team coordinator and teacher, Youth Mavundla.
“It is more than an honour for us to attend this event, but winning these awards leaves us feeling so proud and humbled.”
Esihle Gasa and Asiphile Mkhonde, both in Grade 7, were accompanied by their teacher. It was their first time out of the province and first time flying.
“I just love the London Eye, Big Ben and seeing the guards at Buckingham Palace,” exclaimed an ecstatic Esihle. 
“It made me so happy to meet children from other countries and to hear about what water projects they have been doing,” she added. 
The innovation award was largely due to their ability to make projects happen with few resources.
