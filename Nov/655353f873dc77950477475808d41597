Durban - Opposition parties in the eThekwini Municipality have questioned the Diwali festivals apparently hosted by the city earlier this month, saying the fact that these were driven by the mayor’s office was suspicious.
While both the IFP and DA made it clear they supported Diwali, they felt there was something odd with the six events, which were held in Isipingo, Chatsworth A and B, Effingham, Phoenix and Tongaat. 

Of the R678 000 budgeted for the events, R253 000 was used for catering. This was according to a report tabled at the city’s executive committee on Tuesday. 
DA caucus leader Nicole Graham said her party was pleased that Diwali had been recognised. However, the main concern for the party, which had abstained from voting to approve the report, was the involvement of the mayor’s office in the events.
“No ward councillor should be involved in procurement. No ward councillor should be saying, ‘give so-and-so work’. The mayor should not be involved,” Graham said.

She also questioned why the report was only submitted after the events, saying there should have been better planning.
The DA’s Heinz de Boer and the IFP’s Mdu Nkosi also queried the huge catering budget. “Were there VIPs there?” 
Acting city manager Sipho Cele, said there was a need to provide catering because some wards were vast, adding that he was confident that supply chain management processes had been followed.
