Durban - Grisly details have emerged in the case against three men charged with murder and contravening the Human Tissue Act. The three, Nino Mbatha, Lungisani Magubane and Khayelihle Lamula are accused of murdering Zanele Hlatswayo, 24, and then consuming her body parts. 
The horrific case came to light last year after Mbatha allegedly walked into the Estcourt Police Station and furnished a human hand and foot. He allegedly told police that he was being held against his will and forced to eat human flesh. 

Investigating Officer Nhlanhla Shabalala who testified in court on Thursday, described what police saw when they arrived at the home of one of the men. 
"We saw a bucket with intestines. There was also a large dish with ears, a jaw and shoulders. We were shown the house by Mbatha. He told us to go to a neighbour's house and see what was there," Shabalala said. 
Previously, another investigator in the case, Detective John Cloete, said in a statement that police were shown around the house by Mbatha however, some time later when police returned, the room had been ransacked.

The ransacking of the room was pointed out by Mbatha's legal representation, Advocate Diane Franklin. 
Franklin was cross examining another police official who attended to the scene, Constable Ndumiso Ntshalintshali.
In court on Thursday, Franklin said her client denied knowing Magubane.  

The trial continues.
