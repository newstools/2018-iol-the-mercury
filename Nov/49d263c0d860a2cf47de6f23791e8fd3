Durban - A security guard is lucky to be alive after he came under fire while responding to an emergency call out on Tuesday evening. 
Blue Security’s Andreas Mathios said the officer was alerted to a house robbery in Hollander Crescent, in Morningside.

Mathios said when the officer arrived outside the property, he noticed that driveway the gate was open and that there was a white vehicle parked in the driveway, facing the road. 
“Just as he was about to stop, suspects opened fire on his vehicle. The officer managed to get out of his vehicle and move away from the relentless gunfire as the suspects fired shots at his vehicle, using various weapons including an automatic rifle. Shots smashed a side window and riddled the vehicle with bullet holes. The suspects then fled the scene in the white vehicle. The officer was unharmed,” Mathios said.
He said the resident reported hearing the gates being derailed and a lounge glass door being broken just before the gunshots rang out.

Mathios said the suspects did not manage to take anything from the premises as they had been disturbed by the armed response officer.
Berea police is investigating a case of attempted murder.
