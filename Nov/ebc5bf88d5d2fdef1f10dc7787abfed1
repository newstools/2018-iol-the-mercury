DURBAN - One of Durban’s leading schools that is steeped in tradition as an all boys’ institution will be admitting girls into its special Cambridge Assessment International programme from next year. This change at Glenwood High School follows the appointment earlier this year of Andri Barnes as the first woman principal.
Lisa Foster, deputy director of the Cambridge programme said 10 places would be available to girls from the beginning of next year.

“Already we have a large number of girls who are external candidates,” she said.
While the majority of boys at Glenwood write the mainstream National Senior Certificate matric, a body of them have followed the Cambridge syllabus and written its exams for the past two years.
Foster added that apart from attending lessons in a block committed to the Cambridge pupils - with their male counterparts - Glenwood’s first batch of girls would join the rest of the school for many daily activities.

“Obviously things will evolve as the numbers get bigger,” she said.
“But we shall start off involving them in cultural activities.”
Foster added that the decision to take girls for the Cambridge programme was in line with world trends and market demands.

Traditional boys’ schools in the United Kingdom such as King’s College School had been taking girls for ‘A’ levels, Foster said.
Market demand had come from parents of Glenwood boys studying the Cambridge programme wanting it for their daughters, and homeschoolers.
“We shall now have to develop a girls’ version of the uniform,” she added.
