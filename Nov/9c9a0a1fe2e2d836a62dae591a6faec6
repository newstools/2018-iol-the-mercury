Durban - With school holidays just around the corner, the city of Durban is once again gearing up for a bumper festive season. 
On Thursday, eThekwini Municipality mayor, Zandile Gumede, will be unpacking her region's plans for the thousands of visitors who will descend on Durban beaches in the next few weeks. 

Gumede will be joined by MEC for Economic Development, Tourism and Environmental Affairs, Sihle Zikalala, as she unveils  a multi-pronged holiday plan that includes dispatching additional boats and jet-ski patrols as well as the maintenance of shark nets to prevent possible shark attacks on bathers. 
This week’s launch will involve a walkabout along the beachfront, the installation of shark nets and a media briefing at Elangeni Hotel.
A boat and a helicopter will be used to enable photographers and cameramen to capture the installation of nets and the launch of an army of new jet-skis in action.

Last week, the mayor unveiled the city's brand new fleet of Ricksha buses. The new double-decker buses will replace the old double-decker buses that have been transporting tourists to various parts of Durban and surrounding suburbs. 
These open top buses are similar to the ones operating on the Cape Town tourism routes.
