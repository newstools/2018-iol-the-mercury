DURBAN - Advocate Andrea Johnson, who is one of the 11 candidates that are currently being interviewed for the National Director for Public Prosecution position broke the ice when she spoke isiZulu fluently and eloquently during the tense interviews on Thursday.
The interviews which are being conducted in the presence of the media at the Union Buildings will be completed on Friday.

Johnson, jokingly spoke in isiZulu raising a point about lack of women representation in the interviewer's panel which is made up of men only.  

 




Just after Johnson took a seat to be interviewed, she exchanged greetings with Advocate Majola, who is one of the panelists in IsiZulu and she responded eloquently in isiZulu.
Her response earned her support on social media, with some calling for her to be the next NPA boss.
Majola asked Johnson how she was feeling today, Johnson responded eloquently in isiZulu which loosely translated as: "Sawubona Ntate unjani (Greeting Mr, how are you)".

"Ngiyakhala ngoba kugcwele amadoda, abafazi bakuphi anginalwazi. (I am not well because the panel has too many men, where are the women)," said Johnson.
Majola responded in defence of the panel, that they did not appoint themselves. 
Johnson's clip went viral online and some on Twitter users have wished her the best luck for her braveness and being able to speak IsiZulu fluently.
