Durban - The provincial arm of the Department of Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs refuses to take responsibility for back-pay owed to izinduna.
It says the national department and the premier’s office should foot the bill.

Finance portfolio committee members asked the provincial legislature for an update on the matter on Tuesday.
There are about 3000 izinduna in the province who each earn about R7000 a month. It’s estimated they are owed about R1.2billion in back-pay.
The provincial department told the committee it did not have the money.

The province had delayed paying the salaries for years whereas other provinces had already budgeted for the expense. 
Izinduna are also due a 7% salary increase that was supposed to come into effect last year. 
“We can say that at this point we have not budgeted for paying the back-pay of izinduna,” said the head of the department, Thando Tubane.

Tubane also said the national government was drafting legal requirements that would govern the operation of izinduna. These might include job descriptions.
He said that after the auditor- general complained about the payment and verification of izinduna, it had developed a template to ensure the department did not pay “ghost employees” claiming to be izinduna.
Department spokesperson Lennox Mabaso said: “The template is given to the local inkosi (chief) every month. The inkosi has to sign that these are his izinduna and still in his employ.”

Vusi Mthethwa, the spokesperson for Ubumbano Lwezinduna, the organisation representing izinduna, said they want the back-pay. 
“They (the department) have known about the issue of izinduna salaries for years. There should be a budget for it now,” he said
“Last month, we almost marched to highlight this. We are looking into marching and taking the matter to the public protector to ask for assistance and determine what we should do about it,” said Mthethwa.
