Durban - Police minister, Bheki Cele, has hailed the efforts by the KwaZulu-Natal task team set up to investigate political killings in the province. To date, 46 people have been arrested. 
“Tremendous progress has been made in KwaZulu-Natal by the political killing task team, since the formation of the new team in July 2018. Forty-six people have been arrested with several sentences, as the SAPS we will continue to work hard to bring these types of killings to an end,” he said. 

Cele said while he was satisfied with the 49 convictions since August 2017 to date, he was still concerned that this caliber of criminals are being granted bail. 
“To this end we are working very closely with the Justice, Crime Prevention and Security Cluster to ensure a drastic reduction in the granting of bail to these violent criminals. We are confident that with these interactions we can secure more speedy conviction and lengthy sentences in such cases,” he said. 
Speaking on other successes within SAPS, Cele said to date, 118 cash in transit robberies have been recorded across the nine provinces -compared to the same period last year of 184 cases recorded in 2017 registering a reduction of 36%. 

He said crime intelligence operations between April and November led to the arrests of 237 suspects, the recovery of; 92 vehicles, 78 firearms, 1402 ammunition and a substantial amount of money.
