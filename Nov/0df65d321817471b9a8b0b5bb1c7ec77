Durban - SANRAL has called on the Freedom Front Plus (FF+) to stick to the facts as was provided by the Minister of Transport in the responses provided to the FF+ in Parliament regarding the legality and certification of the toll system.
As per the response provided by the Minister of Transport: “Interim requirements have been developed and accepted by the acting CEO of the National Regulator for Compulsory Specifications (NCRS) in accordance with Section 22 (2)(c) of the Legal Metrology Act.” 

 Furthermore: “The equipment has been type approved in accordance with the interim requirements and a type approval certificate was issued on 16 May 2018 after conclusion of the type approval process.”
SANRAL again assures all road users that its gantries and auxiliary equipment used to determine the vehicle classification - motorcycle, light, medium heavy or heavy vehicles - achieves greater than 99% accuracy due to various auditing and quality control measures. In addition, a photograph of the vehicle is available that can be used to clarify the actual vehicle classification in the event of a dispute.
This specific matter has been dealt with in Court, by the Consumer Commissioner and through various Parliamentary questions posed by the FF+ to the Minister of Transport and the NRCS. Notwithstanding the fact that no non-compliance was found or “admitted to”, the FF+’s continues to misinform the public regarding the facts.
