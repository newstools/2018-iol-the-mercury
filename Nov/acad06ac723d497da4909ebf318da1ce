Durban - Fraud charges against the owners of popular Little Gujarat restaurants and a Chatsworth teacher who were allegedly the masterminds behind a scam to sell medicine and other health science places at the University of KwaZulu-Natal for up to R500 000 has been struck off the roll.
The trio, Varsha and Hiteshkumar Bhatt and Preshni Hiramun appeared in the Pinetown magistrates court today where the State requested a further adjournment of the matter.

 However, the magistrate refused to budge and struck the matter off the roll. 
In May 2017,  an elite team from the Hawks Organised Crime Unit and the National Intervention Unit (NIU) raided the homes and businesses of the trio and arrested them. 
They were charged with fraud and contravention of the Prevention and Combating of Corrupt Activities Act. They were accused of working as agents in cahoots with a syndicate at UKZN to fraudulently enroll students in the health science faculty and school of medicine.
