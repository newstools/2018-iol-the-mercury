Durban - An appeal has been made for witnesses to come forward in a hit-and-run case where five cyclists were knocked earlier this month. 
On November 4, members from the Team Batsalani Cycling Club were riding along the M4 Ruth First Highway when they were struck by a vehicle. The driver of the vehicle then continued driving. The incident took place around 7:45am.

According to Northglen News, one of the cyclists, who was seriously injured in the accident, was Ozair Ally. He suffered whiplash, a concussion, a haematoma to the back and other cuts and bruises from the accident.
Ally told Northglen News that he was the first cyclist hit. 
"I just remember feeling a painful impact in my lower back, I was launched into the air and landed on the ground. I don’t remember much after, when I came to, my teammates were all looking down at me with worried expressions. I thought something was wrong then, the next time I remember coming to was in the ambulance when the paramedic asked about medical aid details,” Ally said. 

Aroon Patel, the chairperson of the eThekwini Cycle Safe Forum and a committee member of the Cycle Specialists Club, said the cyclists were doing a training ride when a car rode too close to them.
 “The driver must have known that he or she bumped someone because the side mirror of the car broke in the process, so the cyclist was hit quite hard,” said Patel.
He said he was concerned that the driver did not stop. “There is no doubt that they knew that they hit somebody,” he said.

He said the cyclists suffered bad bruising, cuts, broken bones and dislocations.
Anyone who may have witnessed the incident, is urged to contact Durban North SAPS on 031 560 8136.
