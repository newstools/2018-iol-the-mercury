Durban - Popular fast-food restaurant Nando's has done it again. 
 

 Known for their hilariously controversial videos and memes, the popular eatery has this taken grabbed hold of the phrase "you people" and is running with it. 

 

 The phrase, which gets many hot under the collar, is usually used to pick on the stereotypes of people and now thanks to the unspoken PC rules, it's basically very degrading to say "you people" to someone. 

 

 So in the Nando's clip... Nope. I am not going to explain it to you, you have to watch the video for yourself!

 



The video has gone viral, amassing more than 100 000 views and shares on social media.
