Durban - While the country is shedding jobs, the future looks bright for KwaZulu-Natal which registered the highest increase of employment in the third quarter.
The Quarterly Labour Force Survey by Statistics South Africa showed that 98000 more people got employment in KZN in the third quarter of 2018. The Western Cape followed with 95000.

Employment losses were recorded in Free State, 48000, Eastern Cape 31000 and North West 4000.
MEC for Economic Development and Environmental Affairs and ANC provincial chairperson Sihle Zikalala was elated by the news.
“It shows that the province is moving towards the promise that we made to better the lives of the people,” he said.

Zikalala lauded the ANC-led government for its initiatives that resulted in the employment figures rising. He said among their recipes for growth was the assistance they gave to small, medium and micro-sized enterprises (SMMEs).
“This enables SMMEs to play a role in the provincial economy which then leads to job creation. We will continue to open doors for small business to play a role in creating more jobs,” said Zikalala.
He also cited the Dube Tradeport and the Richards Bay Industrial Zone as among the reasons for the growth in employment.
