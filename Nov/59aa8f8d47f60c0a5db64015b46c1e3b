Durban - The South African Jewish Board of Deputies (SAJBD) have intervened in an incident where a 14-year-old Treverton College pupil sent an antisemitic voice note to a matriculant on Tuesday night. 
The victim, Danni Heymann reported the incident to the SAJBD and Treverton College. 

“What this boy did was horrifying and I have never been affected by something like this to such a large extent. But because I am the victim of this situation, I am able to see the bigger picture,” she said in a lengthy letter. 
She said an apology from the boy and the school seemed like it wasn’t enough, but for her “it was the halfway point to amending the traumatic situation”.
The SAJBD engaged with the pupils and the relevant schools.In the course of the day, a heartfelt apology was made to Heymann by the perpetrator and his father.

The SAJBD has been engaging with Treverton School and with the Durban Holocaust and Genocide Centre regarding a process of Holocaust education and sensitivity training that the offender and other pupils at the school will embark. The 14-year-old and his family also visited the Johannesburg Holocaust and Genocide Centre. 
“We believe that wherever possible educational processes with a view to behavioural change are critical in addressing antisemitism and indeed all forms of hate in our country. This is especially true when the perpetrators of such hatred are still young, as was the case with this incident,” the SAJBD said in a statement.
