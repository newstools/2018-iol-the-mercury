Durban - EThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede says communities need to be educated about fraud and corruption and warned that if this did not happen the country ran the risk of ending up “becoming like others where fraud and corruption are part of the system”.
In her speech, read out by councillor Thabani Luthuli at a fraud awareness seminar held on Tuesday, the mayor said fighting crime and corruption remained one of the key priorities for the government.

She said elected officials had a constitutional and personal obligation to make decisions that put the interests of the public ahead of their own.
The mayor raised concerns that in some instances allegations of fraud and corruption were used to tarnish the image of politicians and other individuals.
“People can make unfounded accusations just to rubbish your good name. This has become a norm in South Africa and the media is being used to tarnish the names of politicians and, to an extent, Africans. There is an effort to project successful black people or powerful politicians as corrupt. 

“This is the reason we approach courts and press ombudsman to clear our names. Unfortunately, such apologies do not end up on the front pages.”
The seminar was opened by Mbuso Ngcobo, head of the city’s integrity and investigations unit.
Ngcobo said there was a need for increased morality and ethical leadership. 

“Leadership has to be at the forefront of driving anti-corruption programmes in organisations. I am happy we have political leaders who are supporting this initiative because it’s what we need.”
Ngcobo said those who claimed to be fighting corruption needed to be clean. 
“It is sad when you find people implicated in corruption who say they are fighting corruption.”

He said corruption was the enemy of good governance and all people should fight it.
