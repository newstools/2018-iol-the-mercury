Durban - More than 1 500 children go missing in South Africa every year. This is according to organisation, Missing Children South Africa, which has embarked on an aggressive awareness campaign for the annual 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence which began on November 25. 
MCSA was established in 2007 in an effort to assist and support families whose children or loved ones have gone missing. They work closely with the South African Police Service in finding people and creating national awareness.

The first 24 hours after a person goes missing are the most crucial, and with 1697 children going missing every year, the quicker you begin the search, the more chance there is of a positive outcome. The figures released by SAPS Missing Persons Bureau for 2013, also confirm that a child goes missing every five hours. Thanks to the work MCSA is doing, 77% of these children are found. But this still leaves us with the 23% who are not located.
National Coordinator at MCSA, Bianca van Aswegen, said their mission is to give parents and guardians the skills they need to keep themselves and their children safe, like what to look out for and simple daily activities that could assist in the recovery of a child. 
“For example, always have an updated photograph of your child available, and take note of what they are wearing when you go out into a public space. We would like to see that 77% recovery stat increase to 100%. But we also want parents to understand that time is of the essence,” she said. 

Via their Facebook page, the organisation is showcasing tips and guidance for parents and caregivers.
