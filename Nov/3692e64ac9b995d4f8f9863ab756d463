Durban - The Department of Justice and Correctional Services has launched an investigation into the shooting that claimed the lives of two people at the Durban Magistrate's Court on Monday. 
Department Minister, Michael Masutha, has instructed his department to officially investigate the matter. 

On Monday, a Sergeant Phumlani Chiliza entered Regional O Court and fired shots at his estranged wife, Dibuseng Chiliza and her brother, Gert Remoratile Moss. 
Both Dibuseng and Moss died at the scene while Chiliza died some time later in hospital. 
The minister strongly condemned the incident. 

“Information currently at our disposal suggests that this incident is complicated by the fact that the alleged suspect is a member of the South African Police Service, whom court security officials neither knew was an affected party in a case that was being heard nor had any reasonable grounds to suspect that he would be a perpetrator,” the minister said. 
The Minister conveyed his condolences to the families of the deceased.
In a bid to improve security at courts, Masutha said he would consult with the Minister of Police on possible steps to prevent recurrence of similar incidents in future.

"I wish to assure members of the public and court officials that no effort will be spared in ensuring that courts are safe spaces for all who use them," said the Minister
