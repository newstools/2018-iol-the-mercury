Durban - It seems MEC of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs MEC Nomusa Dube-Ncube is on a mission to clean up the province. 
On Wednesday, the MEC authorised a forensic investigation into the goings on at the Umzumbe Municipal Council.  

The investigation will focus on alleged fraud, corruption and maladministration within the municipality. The investigation follows numerous allegations of fraud, corruption and maladministration levelled against senior officials of Umzumbe municipality by various stakeholders, including the local business chamber. 
Last week the operations of the municipality were put on a standstill by some stakeholders alleging malfeasance and demanding the immediate resignation of the Municipal Manager.  
Umzumbe municipal council then wrote a letter requesting the MEC to launch an independent investigation covering all allegations the stakeholders were raising. 

"As we launch this forensic investigation at Umzumbe, we urge everyone with relevant information here to come forward and assist us in the name of transparency and clean governance in our municipalities," said Dube-Ncube.
Once the investigative work is complete and a final report is available, KZN Cogta will consider the findings and recommendations and ensure the municipality takes appropriate actions.
The department is urging all parties to allow the investigation to take its cause and cooperate fully.  

"We are also urging all entrepreneurs who are participating in municipal tenders to observe the necessary procedures and desist from exerting pressure on municipal officials outside of these procedures. This is illegal and it will be investigated," said Dube-Ncube.
