Durban -The Portfolio Committee on Police will on Tuesday receive an update report on the lifestyle audit and vetting of police officials that the National Commissioner identified as a key focus area when he assumed his position.
The committee has for a while now called for a focused campaign of lifestyle audits to root out elements of corruption within the South African Police Service (SAPS). Also, the committee highlighted the importance of vetting all officials entering the service to prevent the service being infiltrated by untoward characters.

“The report will give the committee an idea of progress made in delivering the lifestyle audit and vetting. This, according to the committee, is intended at ensuring that the SAPS regains public confidence in the work it does and that South Africans are and feel safe,” said Francois Beukman, the Chairperson of the committee.
Also under consideration will be a briefing by the SAPS management on their preparations on a safer festive season. Furthermore, the committee will receive an update on interventions by the anti-gang unit. This report will detail the staffing of the unit, resourcing of the unit as well as the impact of interventions already implemented.
