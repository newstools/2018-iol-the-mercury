Durban - The members of the Rotary Interact Club of Tongaat Secondary School took on the 5FM challenge TO BE THE GENERATION. This competition was open to all schools, and is part of the Mandela 100 Global Citizen Festival.
Nalini Pillay said to enter, the team had to send in a profile of the school and say why it is important to look after the community as a school. 

"After being selected as one of the finalists, we were given three challenges to choose from. We chose the challenge that involved recycling, as we felt not enough is being done in the community to promote recycling," Pillay said. 
She said pupils embarked on activities to educate people on recycling and to collect material for reusing and recycling. Each day a voice note had to be sent to 5FM outlining the day’s activities, and photos had to be posted on Facebook.
 On the fifth day, a two-minute video had to be submitted showing all the activities the pupils had embarked on during the week. The videos submitted by all the finalists were uploaded to YouTube.

The winners will be decided by the number of likes received on YouTube. Winning schools will receive tickets to the Global Citizens Concert to be held in Johannesburg, featuring stars such as Beyonce, Jay Z, Ed Sheeran, Sho Madjozi, Wizkid, Pharrell Williams and others.
