Durban - Joburg taxi driver Ayanda Shezi yesterday confessed to being the trigger man in the murder of Durban businessman Kidesh Ramjettan.
Ramjettan was killed in August.

Shezi, who pleaded guilty in the Durban Regional Court, said he carried out the crime after he was paid R12000 of the R30 000 arranged for the murder. 
In his plea statement, Shezi said a man called “Kemang” had arranged the killing and handed over the cash.
He also described the role of his co-accused, Menziwa Mdakane and Zakhele Dubazane. In his plea, Shezi detailed how his co-accused, Mdakane, approached him in August while he was in Gauteng and told him about a “job” he had for him. He said Kemang had offered R30000 for the hit. 

He agreed to the job. 
“A few days later, [Mdakane] said he was going to pick me up. He was with a driver, [Dubazane]. We drove to Durban quickly,” Shezi testified. 
Shezi said they first scouted Glazer Motors on South Coast Road. Mdakane went into the store and showed him who Ramjettan was. 

They returned to the hostel where they were staying. 
The next day Kemang met them, handed the R30000 to Mdakane and told him Ramjettan was at the garage. 
Shezi said that of the R30000, he and Mdakane received R12000 each and the driver got the rest. 

“I walked up to him and shot him in the back of his neck. He fell to the ground and I fired another shot at his head,” he said.
Speaking to The Mercury outside court, Ramjettan’s brother Balraj, said the family believed there was a mastermind who had hired Kemang.
Shezi will be sentenced today.
