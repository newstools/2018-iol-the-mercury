Cape Town - Malusi Gigaba has resigned his position as the minister of home affairs. 
 

 The presidency confirmed that President Cyril Ramaphosa has accepted Gigaba's resignation, which was tendered two weeks after the court ruled that he had been dishonest about the Fireblade private terminal at OR Tambo International Airport.
 
  
 
 
  Calls mounted for Gigaba to resign after he was embroiled in scandal
  , regarding the legal action between himself and the Oppenheimers
   over the VVIP terminal. The Gauteng High Court ruled that Gigaba had lied under oath over the matter. 
  
   
    
     
    
    
     The minister was dealt a blow when the Constitutional Court dismissed his application to appeal the high court ruling. The court said the case was unlikely to succeed. 
    
    
     
    
    
     This was the second blow for Gigaba after the Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane found that Gigaba violated the constitution and the executive ethics code when he told untruths under oath in court. 
    
    
     
    
    
     A video of Gigaba performing a sexual act on himself - which he says was stolen when his phone was hacked - has also been widely circulated on social media, drawing strong criticism from opposition parties.
    
    
     
    
    
     According to the Presidency, Gigaba indicated in his letter of resignation that he was stepping aside "for the sake of our country and the movement to which he belongs". 
    
    
     
    
    
     "Further to relieve the president from undue pressure and allow him to focus on improving the lives of the people of South Africa and for him to do the best he can to serve the country and save it from this economic meltdown."
     
      
     
     Ramaphosa has requested Minister of Transport Dr Blade Nzimande to act as Minister of Home Affairs until a permanent appointment is made.
