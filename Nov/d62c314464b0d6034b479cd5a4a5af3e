 Govender said Game Stores had a queue of people snaking down the corridors. Govender said stores have seen an increase in foot traffic. Govender praised the security teams for keeping things in order. 

 

 Video clips of the doors opening at some major stores showed people pushing their way through, people tripping over and a frantic rush for trolleys. Security guards and goods on display were pushed down by shoppers at the entrances.

 At the Watercrest Mall in Hillcrest, Thorburn Security Solutions were on hand to streamline the queues and averted a rush into the Checkers Store.Most of the shoppers seen entering the store had trolleys already handed out to them in the queues. 

 

 

 While there were huge deals on offer, a post on Facebook by Dala U Crew received some colourful comments about the reality of the frenzy. 

 

 Sudhir Sangham said that people were queuing up at midnight so that they can save R2.50 on Coke and Simba Chips. 

 

 "People’s general level of intelligence seems to drop on Black Friday," he said.

  

 Vishen Sholan Kanhai had some advice for people. 

 

 "Keep some money for next week or next week will be another black Friday,"she said. 

 

 Sushie Naidoo said, "These people won't wake up like this to go to temple or church."

 

 An ardent shopper Zulfah Gabriel said most of the shoppers and her friends opted to shop online to avoid the queues.
