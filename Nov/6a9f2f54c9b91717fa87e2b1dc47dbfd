Durban - The South African Depression and Anxiety Group (Sadag) has been inundated with calls from people seeking help, following the death of Jabulani Tsambo aka HHP.
The calls were for assistance from people who felt helpless, hopeless and desperate for crisis intervention for depression and even suicide.

“This week, we have had so many great numbers of additional suicide callers, concerned family members and even work colleagues calling in to ask for help, information and emergency intervention. Our volunteer counsellors have been fielding hundreds of calls per day, while more people have been reaching out via emails, SMSs and social media,” said Cassey Chambers of Sadag.
The organisation said they usually received up to 600 calls per day, but with the shock and sadness of HHP's death, and the increased press, social media and awareness around depression and suicide, the calls had increased drastically.
The influx of calls has placed a strain on the organisation.

“Sadag is not funded at all by government for the Suicide Helplines, and we have to constantly source money from private donations or corporate's to help pay for the telephone calls. We need more funds,” said Chambers.
