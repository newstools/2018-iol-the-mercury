Durban - We take a look at some of the SABC's biggest financial blunders on the heels of the the 189 retrenchment notice that the corporation issued to all employees earlier this week.
More than 2 000 employees could lose their jobs to save the broadcaster R440 million.

1. The SABC hired auditing company Sekela Xabiso (SkX) to detect irregular, fruitless and wasteful expenditure. The contract was questioned because the value of the SkX contract amounted to R25 million which was contrary to the initial indication of R5 million made by the SABC. In addition, no documents had been made available to indicate the SkX contract was awarded through an open tender process.
2. The broadcaster's acting chief financial officer James Aguma admitted to Parliament’s oversight committee on communications that in its 2013/14 annual report the SABC had disclosed R3.3-billion in irregular expenditure. R990-million of that amount was incurred in the current year,  R1.36 billion was incurred in 2013 and R1 billion in 2012. Aguma also admitted that in the previous year, about R100 million was disclosed as irregular expenditure.

3. The SABC is also approaching the Labour Court to recover money irregularly paid as salary increases which was reported in 2014 by public protector Thuli Madonsela. The report documented irregular appointments, promotions and salary increases of some employees who are no longer with the company.
4. In 2016 cash-strapped SABC purchased an Audi A5 SUV worth R740 000 for the then SABC board chairman Mbulaheni Maguvhe, while the company was struggling to stay afloat and at the time requested staff to take a salary cut. The vehicle is currently parked off at the broadcasters Auckland Park parking lot.
5. A report conducted by the auditor general in 2016 revealed that the SABC had awarded 71 contracts worth R150.7 million to "close family members, partners and associates of officials".

6. SABC announced in 2017 that legal action would be taken to recover millions from former executives Hlaudi Motsoeneng and James Aguma. Motsoeneng’s decision that the SABC should broadcast 90% local content cost the corporation about R183 million in television and R29 million in radio advertising revenue. This decision was made contrary to the policies of the corporation, principles of corporate governance” and in breach of legislation.
7. As the COO of SABC Hlaudi Motsoeneng received a whopping R4.197 milliom annual salary package in the 2015/16 financial year, which made him the highest paid official at the public broadcaster. The SABC made a loss of R411 million in the previous financial year but still increased Motsoeneng’s salary by half a million rand. A report revealed that Motsoeneng received: a basic annual salary of R2.554million; a 13th cheque of R213 000; R945 000’s worth of expenses and other allowances; and employee benefits (contribution to pension fund and medical aid) valued at R485 000.
