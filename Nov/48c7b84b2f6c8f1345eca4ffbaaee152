Cape Town - As life insurer Momentum undertook to refund the premiums for a Shallcross widow whose R2.4 million claim they rejected, social media users had harsh words for the company. 
Momentum came under fire when they reportedly declined an application for a R2.4 million life insurance payout for Durban resident, Nathan Ganas, who was killed trying to protect his wife, Denise, during a hijacking in the driveway of their home last March. 

His claim was declined on the grounds he had not disclosed that he was diagnosed with raised blood sugar levels which may have occurred before he completed his application for the policy in 2014.
