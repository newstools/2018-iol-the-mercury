Durban - Carmen Nan Lee, the mother of slain Durban north woman, Siam Lee, wept in court as details of the day her daughter died were read out in court on Wednesday. 
It was revealed that the cause of Siam's death was “a haemorrhage from head injury (and) 90% burns with charring tissue”.

Lee later said this showed that her daughter had been burned alive.

Sitting at the public gallery behind the accused, Lee wore a black t-shirt with a picture of her deceased daughter printed on it. The words: “Justice for Siam Lee” were printed on the back of the shirt.
A number of sex workers were also present in court as the matter was heard.
The details about the charges against the accused were read out by state prosecutor as part of the formal proceedings before the matter moves to the Durban High Court on March 11 next year.

The accused cannot be named as he is facing a rape charge in another case. 
He is facing 16 counts of various charges including murder, kidnapping, unlawful possession of firearm and ammunition and crimen injuria.
Some of the charges relate to other incidents and not that of Siam Lee’s murder

The accused later asked the court for a relaxation of his bail condition which requires him to report to a police station, three times a week. The accused had wanted this to be reduced to once a week, but the Magistrate ruled that the conditions will stand.
