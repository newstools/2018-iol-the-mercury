 On Thursday, she released a statement saying," I have
  learned that the person behind the text message I received last night is known to me and has admitted they were “playing a prank”  They have expressed deep regret and shame for their conduct and acknowledge they did not think their actions through."

 

 Tedder said the hours since receiving the texts were extremely traumatic for her and her family. 

 

 "We believed there was a real threat on my life. This 'joke' 
 highlights that there are some issues that just should never be trivialized or made light of. It is never funny and it’s never ok! So many people rallied to support and help me and I am grateful for that," she said. 

 

 Earlier this year, Tedder wrote the book detailing acts of abuse during a previous relationship.
