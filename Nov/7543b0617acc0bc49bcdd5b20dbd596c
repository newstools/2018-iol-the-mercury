Durban - The fight with Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan is likely to escalate because the EFF has made him its main target, an analyst has said.
“It seems they have substituted (Jacob) Zuma with Gordhan as their target man,” said political analyst Bukani Mngoma.

Mngoma said the EFF accusation that Gordhan targeted black excellence at state-owned enterprises might be meant to divert attention from the negative press it had had over the VBS Bank scandal.
Professor Mcebisi Ndletyana said: “It is surprising that a party which purports to fight corruption is against the state capture proceedings. They may fear the proceedings will go against them.”
Ndletyana said Gordhan had received as much support as he would get from the ANC. “A number of people within the party are implicated in state capture. The kind of support he has is not surprising given the kind of ANC we’ve had over the past eight years.”

Meanwhile, civil society groups including the Active Citizens Movement (ACM) have started to coalesce around Gordhan, much as they did when he was fired from the Cabinet last year.
The ACM said the attacks directed at people who testified at the Zondo commission were an attempt to “force a shutdown”. It said it would ask the commission to subpoena EFF leader Julius Malema.
