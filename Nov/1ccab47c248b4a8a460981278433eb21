Durban - Local jazz pianist and composer Sibusiso "Mash" Mashiloane received an award for best artist in African jazz at the All Africa Music Awards (Afrima) in Ghana at the weekend.
He was nominated for a track from 2017 called Niza, taken from his second album titled Rotha - A Tribute to Mama.

In a social media post, Mashiloane - who was also nominated for Best Male Artist in Southern Africa - dedicated the award to his late mother.
“This award is for my mother - may her soul rest in peace, Ndlondlo,” wrote Mashiloane.
Mashiloane said the song was influenced by his background.

“I have listened to and watched a lot of traditional dancers, from iZangoma to amaSokane, and the sound and movements are what inspired me to compose Niza,” said Mashiloane.
Earlier this month, Mashiloane said his music was embedded in society and he would not be able to compose music without the influence of his country and the city in which he lived.
The pianist, who is also a lecturer at the University of KwaZulu-Natal and Durban Music School, also thanked his family and students.

“Thanks to God, who enables me. Thanks to my family, church, colleagues and students. 
“Thanks to our early musicians, who stood the test of time in documenting their talents and our community stories,” he said.
Armed with a cum laude Master’s degree in jazz performance from UKZN, Mashiloane is working on his PhD, which focuses on South African composers.

South African hip hop musician Nasty C won the award for Best Male Artist in Southern Africa for his song Jungle.
Shekhinah - who is also from Durban - walked away with the award for the Best Female Artist in Southern Africa for Please Mr, and the Songwriter of the Year Award along with Amon Taulo Chibiya II for Different featuring Mariechan.
