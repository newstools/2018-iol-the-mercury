Durban - A man was shot dead and four others injured during an attempted jail break from the Isipingo police station holding cells.
SAPS provincial spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane confirmed that charges of murder, attempted murder and escaping from lawful custody were opened at the station. He also said that the wounded and the deceased were suspects. No police officers had been injured.

“The circumstances surrounding the shooting and escape is under investigation,” he said.
Zwane added that the deceased had held up officers with a firearm.
Aidan David, chairperson of the Isipingo Community Police Forum, who visited the scene, said he was told that the deceased had been arrested for allegedly stealing wheel rims and tyres.

David said that the man had allegedly tried to escape when an officer went to the cells to give the prisoners food.
“The police officer opened the cell and asked them to all step back, which is normal procedure. 
“He bent down to leave the tray of food and when he picked his head up, he saw a firearm pointed at him,” said David.
