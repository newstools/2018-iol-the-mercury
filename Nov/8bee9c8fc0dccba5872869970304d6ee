DURBAN - Police have resumed a search of an 11-year-old child who was swept out to sea while swimming off Kidd's Beach, near Leisure Bay on the KwaZulu-Natal South Coast.
Spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said on Wednesday that the Port Shepstone Search and Rescue Unit had started looking for her on Tuesday. She was swept out to sea shortly before noon on that day in spite of efforts to rescue her.

The National Sea Rescue Institute’s Port Edward station commander added that it appeared that bystanders using a body board had reached the child in the surf.
“But they were unable to secure the child before the surf swept the child away from them and they were forced to return to shore,” he said.
Conditions in the area today were expected to be windy, humid and with no rain, according to weather.com.

Police said the child was a local, from the nearby area of Latshoda.
