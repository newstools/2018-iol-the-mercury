LETTER - One can respect former minister Nhlanhla Nene for taking the rap and quietly exiting after he felt compromised by his personal meetings with the Saxonwold vegetarian curry house.
He resigned and exited the political scene. 

Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba, however, continues to be plagued by bad publicity and his stories are becoming a bit tedious. 
Over the weekend it was some sordid footage. If this was a private matter and someone blackmails you, the best advice is tell your blackmailers to get lost. Politicians were not, and never be will, saints. 
Now he is accused of lying under oath by none other than the Zuma’s favoured public protector. 

In the Jacob Zuma era, all sorts of excuses and delaying tactics could be used, but, as a politician, Gigaba had his bets on Team Zuma, and, like many others, switched sides in accordance with where their bread was buttered. 
It took enormous courage for President Cyril Ramaphosa to appoint him ahead of many of his own supporters. 
It is time to reciprocate for the respect shown. 

Gigaba would do both the country and himself a great favour by stepping down as minister and sitting in the House as an ordinary MP.
He might end up chairing some committee, which won’t be too bad. It won’t take long and given his astuteness he will probably be some minister or even ambassador. 
Do South Africa a favour and resign.
