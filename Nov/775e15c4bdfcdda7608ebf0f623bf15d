Durban - Police in KwaZulu-Natal have warned residents to be alert at all times and not to allow strangers into their homes. 
This warning comes after reported incidents in the province where the criminals gain entrance into properties under false pretenses and rob the occupants.

SAPS spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbele said the modus operandi is such that criminals would often arrive at a property clad in blue work wear and when the victims open the gate, they would then be robbed of their valuables.
“The community need to be cautious and alert at all times. Do not let the strangers into your home, ask for an identity document or work identification card as proof of employment,” said Mbele.
She also said another current trend was where criminals arrive in luxury vehicles and hoot at the gates.

“Most often the owners never check before opening the gates. Criminals are employing this modus operandi as they are aware that most residents are very lax,” said Mbele.
Meanwhile with the festive season almost here,  Fidelity ADT’s national Marketing and Communications Manager, Charnel Hattingh said that for both work and private home gatherings, a casual security guard could deter criminals.
“The reality exists that criminals are aware that social gatherings generally mean easy pickings and easy targets. This year we have seen a lot of opportunistic crimes when people are entering their driveways and a proactive guard presence can do much to minimise this threat,” she said.
