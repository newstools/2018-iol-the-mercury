Durban - Pietermaritzburg businessman and convicted murderer Rajivee Soni’s application for leave to appeal against his conviction was postponed to December 12 in the Durban High Court. 
 

 The matter was adjourned as the judgment on his conviction and sentencing was not yet available.

Soni is serving a 30-year jail sentence at New Prison in Pietermaritzburg for the 2013 murder of Dr Bhavish Sewram. 

He was not in court  but his family and friends were present to support his application. 

Soni was convicted and sentenced to 25 years for murder, five years for defeating the course of justice, 18 months for assault and five years for conspiracy to commit murder. 

Judge Jacqui Hendriques ruled the sentences would run concurrently and jailed Soni to an effective 30 years. 

Sewram, a father of two, was gunned down outside his surgery in Raisethorpe in May, 2013. 

Soni was found guilty last month for being the mastermind behind the murder after he suspected that Sewram was involved in a relationship with his wife. He hired former policeman Brian Treasurer to carry out the hit and paid him R100000. 

Treasurer died in prison while serving a life sentence for the murder. 

Hitman Mfaniseni Nxumalo is serving a life sentence for his part in the murder.
