Durban - A 13-year-old girl was killed and dozens of shacks were destroyed, in a fire at the Parkington informal settlement, in Greenwood Park, on Saturday night.
Police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said the 13-year-old had been in one of the shacks that caught alight and died at the scene.

Stanley Moonsamy, ANC proportional representation councillor for Ward 34, went to the scene. He said the child had lost her mother at the beginning of the year and was living with her older brother and uncle.
“Her father has been told and is on his way to the area,” said Moonsamy.
While firefighters were trying to extinguish the blaze, Moonsamy said community members attacked them.

“One rescue appliance and a water carrier were abandoned by firefighters and retrieved with the assistance of metro police and the SAPS,” he said.
Gwala confirmed the incident and said community members demanded that the firefighters hand over their equipment so that they could extinguish the fire themselves. 
“The police intervened and the matter was resolved. No injuries were reported,” said Gwala.

Moonsamy praised residents in the area and NGOs for coming to the aid of those affected who had lost all they had in the fire.
“The DeSai Group and other NGOs stepped in to assist with meals, among other things, and the community hall is being used to accommodate the residents.
“We want to thank volunteers for their humanitarian assistance in this difficult period for the families,” he said.

Moonsamy said the families had started cleaning up and were trying to rebuild their homes.
Gwala said the cause of the fire was not known - police are investigating.
