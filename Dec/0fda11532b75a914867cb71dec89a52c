Johannesburg - Social media on Friday reacted strongly to President Cyril Ramaphosa's defence of embattledÂ womenâ€™s minister Bathabile Dlamini.
 

 Ramaphosa had a wide-ranging interview
 Â on Radio 702 with Xolani Gwala during which he defended his decision to keep Dlamini in his Cabinet, saying she was doing a fantastic job and has raised the bar and dismissed claims the ANC Women League president was "untouchable"

 

 His comments raised eyebrows on social media, with some users saying his defence of Dlamini was an insult to South African women.Â 

 

 Other tweeps questioned which bar Dlamini raised, while some speculated that Dlamini had "files" on the president, hence his reluctance to get rid of her.Â

Cyril Ramaphosa last night said Bathabile Dlamini raised the bar. Cyril is afraid of Bathabile, he knows very well that if he touches her, his Smallernyana skeletons will be out. #RamaphosaOn702 pic.twitter.com/p5lqstEM6U

This drunkard mismanaged @OfficialSASSA into near collapse and the constitutional court found her reckless and grossly negligent yet @PresidencyZA @CyrilRamaphosa praises her.This sums up why SA is falling apart and why the ANC can't be trusted. #RamaphosaOn702 https://t.co/zaFEWTa4ZH

Great interview last night @gwalax @CyrilRamaphosa I have a lot of faith in our president except for his recommendation of #bathabiledlamini - which is an insult to women everywhere. We have such a problem with violence against women & children & itâ€™s just getting worse ðŸ˜”

Iâ€™m not satisfied with our Presidentâ€™s response on #BathabileDlamini. She definitley has smaller-nyana skeletons on the ANC leadership. pic.twitter.com/o7WRnLU2Xd
