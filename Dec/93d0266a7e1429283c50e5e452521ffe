Durban - The Ugu Municipality says the closure of the Umzimkhulu River mouth will not affect the water quality on the South Coast this festive season.
As holidaymakers make their way to the province's coastline, the municipality said, social media posts had created panic among residents and visitors that the breaching of the river mouth would cause an increase in the salinity of the purified water.

The river is Ugu’s biggest source of water. 
“The municipality is monitoring the salt content of the river constantly and we confirm that it is currently very low, thus having no effect on the water supplied to customers,” the municipality's Sphelele Cele said.
Plans to breach the mouth are in place and the process is planned for this week.

He said the municipality was waiting for there to be enough water in the river to allow for a successful breach.
“All residents and holidaymakers can rest assured that the municipality will provide them with quality drinking water,” Cele said. 
Compared to previous years, water restrictions at the coastal resorts are not expected to be as stringent. 

The regional director of First Group properties in KwaZulu-Natal, Johann Jordaan, said their holiday properties in the North and South coast were well-prepared for the influx of visitors this festive season. 
He said First Group properties were well set to save water this festive season thanks to boreholes and rooftop rainwater collection in the standby tanks, which had been installed at most coastal and inland destinations. 
“We also continue to promote water-saving initiatives through awareness campaigns that have led to a change in our guests’ water usage for the better,” Jordaan said. 

Dewet Geldenhuys of the Umhlanga Precinct said that as much as visitors were urged to continuously save water, restrictions would not be harshly imposed as compared to previous years.
