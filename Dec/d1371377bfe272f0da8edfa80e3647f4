Durban - Durban Metro police officers were shocked when a minibus taxi, certified to only carry twelves passengers, had found twenty-five passengers were crammed into it on Monday. 
Durban Metro police spokesperson Superintendent Parboo Sewpersad said that officers were shocked when they inspected the taxi at a vehicle checkpoint at the Kenyon Howden and South Coast Road intersection. 

The officers then recorded their find on a cellphone for evidence. Sewpersad urged passengers to stand up for their rights and taxi drivers who pack them into taxis. He did not know which area the taxi had been travelling from. 
"This is not acceptable. This could be somebody's granny, grandfather, mother, father, uncle, aunt, sister, brother etc. If something happened they could all possibly have been dead," Sewpersad said.
