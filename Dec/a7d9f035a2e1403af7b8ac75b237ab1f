Durban - High crime levels in our province call for radical action and a “united front against crime”, Transport, Community Safety and Liaison MEC Mxolisi Kaunda said at a provincial summit on Tuesday.
The summit, with the theme “Declaring war against crime in KZN”, aims to streamline and integrate crime- fighting initiatives, identify key drivers of crime and enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the criminal justice system.

Kaunda said a radical approach needed to begin with the mindset of communities. 
“Let the fight against crime start with families. Hence the province has established the Social Cohesion and Moral Regeneration Council to restore family values,” he said.
Kaunda said that to achieve peace and stability in the province, factors that drove crime should be removed from society, including illegal firearms, drug abuse and alcoholism.

“We need to build positive societal attitudes and values by increasing the strength, capacity and resilience of individuals, families and communities in relation to the known risk factors that make communities unsafe,” he said.
Kaunda added that there had been an increase in violence at schools and tertiary institutions.
“I am pleased to report that working with the CPFs (community policing forums), youth desks and many others, we have launched a campus safety programme to create a safe environment in institutions of higher learning in our province.”

Kaunda said the department had been intervening in other crime hot-spot areas in the province.
Acting provincial police commissioner Lieutenant-General Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi said the public had lost faith in the police and especially in the court system.
“There is a need for the community, business and government departments, especially our partners within the criminal justice system, to work together to make sure we win this war against crime,” he said.
