Burst water pipes coupled with high demand in the uThongathi area has led to a number of suburbs being left with little or no water over the past three weeks.
People living in Watsonia, Buffelsdale, Chelmsford Heights, Flamingo Heights, Gandhinagar and Mithanagar have had intermittent water supply since November.

EThekwini spokesperson Msawakhe Mayisela said the city was aware of the water issues affecting the uThongathi area.
“The water supply demand is very high in these areas and once there are interruptions, such as burst pipes and power failures, the demands become unbearable to fill reservoirs,” he said.
Mayisela said the latest water woes were caused due to burst pipes in Calendula and Coronation roads. He said water tankers had been deployed to the affected areas.

“A water tanker has also been deployed to Redcliffe Tower after the water supply was disrupted by the current electricity problem,” he said.
On the other side of the city, some Glenwood residents experienced a power blackout for almost 40 hours.
People living in Glenwood, Bulwer and Westridge said their electricity supply had been intermittent since Tuesday.

Mayisela said the city’s electricity unit had received numerous reports of power outages across the suburbs.
“Investigations have revealed that the outages are due to the humidity levels we are currently experiencing. We have technicians working tirelessly to mitigate the challenges,” he said.
Mayisela urged members of the public to urgently contact the city’s electricity department on 0803111111 or email custocare@elec.durban.gov.za to report power outages in their areas. “Once the report has been made, a reference number will be provided. Having a reference number on hand when following up on a report is vital as this assists us in tracking the fault.”
