Durban - With the festive season drawing closer, police are warning mall management to step up their security. 
The warning comes after a gang of armed men stormed into a jewellery store at the Seadoone Mall earlier today. 

Armed with 10-pound hammers, the gang smashed their way through the shop's display cabinets. According to reports, two of the men were armed with firearms and two with hammers. 
KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane, said Amanzimtoti police opened a case of armed after a jewellery shop was robbed by four unknown suspects this afternoon.  
"Suspects fled the scene in their getaway vehicle. Earrings and gold chains were taken," Zwane said. 

Last year, gangs using similar modus operandi struck at a number of malls across the city. 
In September 2017, a gang of seven men, armed with sledgehammers, pounded their way through the glass doors of Checkers Liquor Shop at a Virginia shopping centre.
Weeks before that, a gang pounced at a jewellery store at City View shopping centre in Greyville. 

"The men had smashed the glass doors and then ransacked the jewellery counter," said Kyle van Reenen, Marshall Security spokesperson.
At the beginning of the 2017, police set up a provincial mall robbery task team to investigate the incidents.
