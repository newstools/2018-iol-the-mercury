Durban - Police are closing in on the man who opened fire and shot a dog four times in Winston Park, near Hillcrest, on Tuesday night.
The details around the shooting were not immediately clear yesterday, but The Mercury understands that police may have a description of the vehicle the man was driving or the vehicle’s number plate. 

Paul Housten, from Winston Park Guardians, said at about 9.30pm on Tuesday, a man had driven to the cul-de-sac in Winston Park, west of Durban, pulled a gun and shot the dog four times. 
“At this stage, this is being handled by the SPCA and the police were at the scene. We do not know who was responsible for the shooting, this is the first time that something like this has happened here,” he said.
Resident Vivian Michell said she was getting ready for bed when she head the sound of a car and she thought it was her son coming home. 

“I heard the shot and I ran to my balcony and I saw the dog was trying to run away from him. He shot again and I rushed to wake my husband and I wanted to shout at the man, but my husband said I should not.
“My husband said the man shot the dog for the fourth time to make sure it was down, I heard it yelped two times, even my dogs were scared, it was horrible,” she said. 
Sue Noakes, inspectorate manager at the Kloof and Highway SPCA, said the organisation had been asked by police not to speak about the investigation.
