Durban -  It was a bleak Christmas for families living in the Hoffman Road informal settlement after a fire swept through it on Tuesday.

  

  Hassan Haniff, eThekwini ward 25 councillor, said approximately sixty shacks caught alight on Christmas morning. Haniff said the cause of the fire was unknown but he said it spread quickly to other shacks because they are built close by. 

 

 The informal settlement is situated on the hill above the intersection of Henry Road and Felix Dlamini (Brickfield) Road. 

 

 "The Durban Fire department arrived promptly and stopped the fire from spreading even further. The eThekwini disaster management came out and began taking down the details of those affected,"Haniff said.

 With most of the people gone on holiday's some of the shacks were unoccupied said Haniff. 

 

 "I visited the area and there were very few people at the settlement. Relief has been coming in for those affected,"he said.
