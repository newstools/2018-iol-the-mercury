Durban - A teacher, who was part of the National Senior Certificate marking team at the Pietermaritzburg Girls High School, has passed away. Philani Thokozani Gumede reportedly fell sick and passed away prior to the arrival of an ambulance. 
Department of Education in KwaZulu-Natal MEC, Mthandeni Dlungwane, said a team of senior officials was dispatched to the marking centre to attend to the situation. 

“At this moment we do not wish to speculate what might have been the cause of his death but we are going to wait for the post-mortem results and determine whether there is a need to investigate further or not,” Dlungwane said. 
He said while Gumede’s colleagues were in shock, the marking process had not been affected. 
“We will make the necessary arrangements through its sister Department of Social Development in KZN to ensure that professional therapy is provided to his colleagues who are obviously affected by this sad incidence,” the MEC said. 

The Department of Education in KwaZulu-Natal wishes to convey warm condolences to the friends and family of the deceased.
Gumede was employed as a teacher in Ibiva High school which falls under Umkhanyakude district.
