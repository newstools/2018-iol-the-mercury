Durban - In December 2017, three-year-old Siphesihle Zamangwane Dlamini, was allegedly abducted during a church service in Amandawe on the KwaZulu-Natal South Coast. 
For the last 12 months, her family has never lost hope that one day their little girl will come back to them. 

Thabsile Dlamini, the girl’s mother, had taken her to a Christmas Eve church service. 
At the time, Dlamini had gotten up from her seat and went to the front of the church to greet the congregation. Little Siphesihle was playing with her mother’s bag and stayed seated. 
When Dlamini returned to her seat, her daughter was gone. 

Members of the church began looking for Siphesihle but she was nowhere to be found. 
Children who were playing outside at the time claimed that they had not seen the girl. 
On December 1, Siphesihle turned four. 

Despite a R40 000 reward being offered for her safe return, Siphesihle is still missing. 
A Facebook group, Help Find Missing Siphesihle, has been started and photographs of the girl are regularly shared in the hopes that she will be found.
