Durban - Blue Security has warned motorists to be vigilant when driving along the N2 near the Sibiya offramp after a rock was thrown at a motorist's vehicle earlier on Thursday.
Blue Security community and media liaison officer Andreas Mathios said a Waterfall businesswoman was driving along the N2 northbound carriage way before the offramp when the rock struck her vehicle this morning.

"The motorist was driving in the slow line about 200 meters from the Sibiya offramp when the rock hit her vehicle out of nowhere. She was not near any bridges so it is unclear at this stage from where the suspect may have stood and thrown the rock at her vehicle. She fortunately kept her wits about her and carried on driving to safety without stopping although the rock had caused extensive damage to the passenger side of her windscreen which had to be replaced. Fortunately, the motorist was not harmed during the incident," Mathios said.
Mathios urged motorists to be vigilant when driving along the highways and to never stop at the side of the road to assess damage to the vehicle in such cases. "Rather drive on to the safety of the nearest garage or police station and contact the police and your security company for assistance. When travelling always make sure you have a fully charged cellphone with you and that family or business associates are aware of your movements, especially if you are a woman driving alone," Mathios said.
 Mathios added that it was beneficial for motorists to know how to retrieve a GPS pin and to provide emergency services with a GPS co-ordinate of their exact location.

The case was reported to the Kloof SAPS.Â
