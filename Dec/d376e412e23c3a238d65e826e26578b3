Durban - A second suspect has been arrested in connection with a syndicate that was allegedly manufacturing fake certificates.
Mtubatuba police were acting on information provided by an informant, who was caught trying to register with a fake security and training certificate, at the Private Security Industry Regulatory Authority (Psira) office in Durban last month.

Psira spokesperson Velisile Bukula said after further investigation, the informant's information led to the identification of a 37-year-old woman, who is alleged to be higher up in the operation.
Bukula said the woman was found in possession of fraudulent certificates, including matric certificates, an SAPS competency certificate, a shooting certificate and a Psira certificate.
The woman alleged it had been manufactured by Zipho Mhlongo, who appeared in the Ntuzuma Magistrate's Court on fraud charges last week.

Mhlongo was found with fake matric certificates and Psira certificates.
Buluka added that it is believed the woman provides the fraudulent certificates to other provinces as well.
He said the syndicate was charging R750 per certificate. 

Police spokesperson, Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane confirmed the woman's arrest and said she would appear in the Mtubatuba Magistrate's Court today.
Buluka said Psira was “happy” that its work had led to the arrest of members of the syndicate.
“People should stop trying to take short cuts when they want Psira certificates and private security training certificates because they will be arrested,” said Buluka.

He said Psira was working around the clock to clean up the private security industry.
