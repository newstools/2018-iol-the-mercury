Durban - R6 million worth of counterfeit clothing was confiscated during a sting operation at the King Shaka International Airport recently.  The find follows a two-day operation undertaken by the South African Revenue Services (Sars). 
 The operation saw Sars officials conducting a high-visibility operation in and around KSIA, along with their counterparts from SAPS, Immigration, Cross Boarder Road Traffic Agency and Metro Police. 

 The aim of the operation was to clamp down on issues of non-compliance regarding the import and export of goods. 
 It also focused on the smuggling of illegal substances and the illegal movement and storage of secondhand goods. 
According to Sars, officials made the bust during random inspections. 

Sars said in a separate operation in Tongaat, at least 30kg of dagga was found during a roadblock. 
Sars said the dagga, which was packed in suitcases in the boot of the car, was positively identified by customs detector dogs. It is valued at about R2 million.
Officials also discovered suspected counterfeit nappies which were packed into in a 40-foot container at the Durban harbour.
