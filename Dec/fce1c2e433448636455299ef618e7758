Durban - Five people lost their lives and 28 others were injured in accidents across KwaZulu-Natal over the long weekend.
A 47-year-old woman was killed when the car she and her three daughters were travelling in overturned and landed on its roof on the N2 northbound before the Higginson highway off-ramp on Sunday morning.

It is believed that the family were preparing for the eldest daughter’s wedding that was scheduled to take place that day.
Rescue Care spokesperson Garrith Jamieson said paramedics found the vehicle on its roof in the middle of the highway.
“The driver had sustained major injuries. There was nothing more that paramedics could do for her, and she was declared deceased on the scene,” he said.

The other three occupants of the vehicle sustained various injuries and were transported to hospitals in the area.
Police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said a case of culpable homicide was being investigated by the Montclair SAPS.
In a crash yesterday, a father and his 11-year-old child suffered serious injuries on the N2 southbound before the Higginson highway.

“They sustained serious injuries and were stabilised on scene by advanced life support paramedics before being transported to a nearby hospital,” Jamieson said.
In another incident yesterday, 18 people were injured after a taxi overturned in Pietermaritzburg, ER24 spokesperson Ineke van Huyssteen said.
On Saturday, four people were killed and five others sustained various injuries when their vehicle overturned on the N3 near the Bergville toll plaza.

ER24 spokesperson Werner Vermaak said: “Paramedics found the occupants ejected from the vehicle. Sadly, four people, including a young child, had already succumbed to their injuries.” He said five others were transported to Ladysmith Provincial Hospital for further care.
