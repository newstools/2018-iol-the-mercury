Durban - The Howick father, who suffered severe injuries when he fell off a Karkloof Falls cliff in October, has been discharged from hospital.
André Pretorius spent 54 days in hospital, including almost two weeks in a medically induced coma, due to head injuries and internal bleeding.

André’s wife, Mar-Louise, also fell while trying to save her husband and suffered a broken shoulder, broken hip and fracture on the left side of her face.
Mar-Louise said the journey of recovery has been long and stressful.
Mar-Louise was discharged on the same day her husband woke from his coma. She said now that André was home, she wasn't worried about herself.

“I used to have a lot of pain, but now that André is here, there isn't time to think or feel,” she said. 
She added that he was doing better each day, although he still got confused at times.
The couple, who dropped their medical aid to fund their boy Liam’s speech therapy before the incident, are both unable to drive to receive further treatment in Pietermaritzburg.

She said the Howick community, who had rallied to help them to pay medical bills, again offered to help. 
“A nurse is checking up on André and a physio has said he would help. We are also getting trauma counselling from Sue van Rensburg,” said Mar-Louise.
 André will get to see Liam this week, for the first time since the incident, when he returns from Cape Town, where he has been staying with his grandparents.

Mar-Louise said the medical bills came to about R400000 and through the help of friends, family and an appeal on crowdfunding site BackaBuddy, R140000 had been raised to assist with the debt.
“Everything we receive is greatly appreciated and I thank God for everyone who made this ordeal bearable,” she said.
