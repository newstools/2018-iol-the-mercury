Durban - "Please show your support for baby Miguel and wear blue."  This is the plea made by the family of Miguel Louw who will come face to face with the man charged for the 9-year-old's murder on Wednesday.
 

 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
  The family is appealing to residents to come to the Durban Magistrate's Court to support their appeal against the accused's bail application. 
 
 
  
 
 
  Mohammed Ebrahim was officially arrested for Miguel's murder last week as he was due to appear on charges relating to the boy's alleged kidnap. 
 
 
  
 
 
  This story gripped the hearts of the community earlier this year after Miguel was reported missing. 
 
 
  
 
 
  In July, Miguel was allegedly fetched from school by Ebrahim and the pair were seen at a food outlet not far from Miguel's primary school. Miguel then allegedly boarded a taxi and that was the last time the youngster was seen in the vicinity of his home. 
 
 
  
 
 
  Following a search, spanning almost three months, Miguel's decomposing body was found in Phoenix, mere metres from Ebrahim's home. Despite the overwhelming case against Ebrahim, the man denied being involved in the boy's disappearance and death. 
 
 
  
 
 
  In fact, in an exclusive interview with the Daily News, Ebrahim said he was fond of Miguel. 
 
 
  
 
 
  He told the Daily News that he was s
  hocked when he heard the news that Miguel was dead. 
 
 
  
 
 
  Ebrahim is due to appear in court on Wednesday.
