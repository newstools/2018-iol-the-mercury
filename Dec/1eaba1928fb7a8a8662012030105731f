Durban - At least nine car guards were taken in for questioning following a joint operation by the Private Security Industry Regulatory Authority (PSiRA) on Monday. Local police were also involved in the operation.


 



"The operation will be focusing on private security businesses that are non-compliant and arrests are imminent for transgressors," Bukula said. 
The first leg of the operation took teams from PSiRA and local police officers to the Windermere Centre where they checked the paperwork of those working as car guards. 


 




PSiRA media officer, Velisile Bukula, said the major operation will be conducted over two days.
