Durban - The Richmond Municipality is still in chaos. The council on Monday approved the appointment of an acting municipal manager just as the incumbent was preparing to return to work after withdrawing her special leave.
Bongiwe Mnikathi told The Mercury yesterday that the council was aware that she was returning to work this week.

Mnikathi had been on leave from November 1 after her relations with some councillors, including those in leadership posts, soured. 
As a result of the bad blood, the council tried to suspend her, which led to bitter court battles.
She has also faced resistance from employees in the municipality, who protested and blockaded the gates in protest against her return to work.

This forced the provincial Department of Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs to intervene. 
The Mercury understands that in her letter, Mnikathi had said she wanted to take leave after being advised that she was not safe. She also needed time to tend to her health.
Spokesperson for the municipality Sibonelo Bhengu said the council had endorsed a decision to bring in Sibusiso Mkhize as acting municipal manager. He was seconded from the district municipality.

He said Mnikathi had written to the municipality advising she wanted to come back to work and had received a response stating that court processes were still pending and so the withdrawal of leave went against the spirit of her initial application.
Mnikathi said she felt she had done nothing wrong. She had dealt with the safety issue by beefing up her personal security and had seen to her health.
Department spokesperson Lennox Mabaso did not want to comment, intending to deal with the matter internally to ensure a lasting solution.
