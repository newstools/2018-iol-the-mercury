Durban - Three people had to be rescued from a sinking catamaran on Tuesday morning. 
It is believed that the vessel started taking in water offshore of the uMgeni River Mouth.

National Sea Rescue Institute spokesperson, Craig Lambinon said the sea rescue craft, Megan II, was launched and it was confirmed that all three people had been safely rescued from the catamaran. The men were not injured. 
"When our team arrived at the scene, they found the semi-submerged vessel had taken in water but it was unclear why. Once the men were safely left on land and our members returned to the vessel, they secured a towline and were asked to tow the catamaran out of the shipping lanes and away from danger," he said.
Lambinon said the deep-sea rescue craft, Eikos Rescuer II, was launched and took up the towline to the catamaran and during a tow towards Durban's Port, a tow hampered by the weight of the semi-submerged casualty craft.

"It was initially considered to the tow the catamaran into the Port of Durban but then confirmed that the owners had appointed salvors and the salvors, in cooperation with TNPA Port Control, requested NSRI's assistance to tow the catamaran to shallow water at Vetchie's Pier. Our team towed the catamaran, semi-submerged, to Vetch's Pier. Once at the Pier, the vessel was secured," Lambinon said. 
He said the circumstances that led to the vessel's carnage will be investigated further by the South African Maritime safety Authority.
