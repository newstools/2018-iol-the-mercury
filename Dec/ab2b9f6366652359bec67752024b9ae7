Durban - Gareth Newham of the Institute for Security Studies (ISS) said although “career criminals” were a problem in South Africa, it was not unique to the country.
Newham, who specialises in corruption, crime, statistics and surveys, said career criminals worked with a network of other criminals and spend their lives committing crime. 

“It is their livelihood. They earn their income from committing crime,” he said. 
Newham said that even prison could not stop a career criminal from committing crimes and even behind bars they had a hand in criminal activity. 
“Police need to make effective use of their intelligence experts and constantly and strategically monitor these career criminals. In the police’s crime reduction strategy, they need to identify them,” Newham said.

He said that effective prosecution would ensure such criminals were in jail and their access limited. 
He also urged police to track such criminals who were released from prison. “Tracking them would prevent more crimes from happening. In this case, if the suspect had been tracked from the time he was released in March, this murder could have been prevented,” he said.
