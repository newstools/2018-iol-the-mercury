Durban - The case against an ANC ward councillor, who has been charged with the murder of a fellow councillor, was postponed in the Umlazi Magistrate’s Court yesterday.
Mthokozisi Nojiyeza, the Ward 80 councillor in Umlazi, appeared briefly along with his co-accused and brothers, Nkosingiphile and Phumlani Nojiyeza.

The three have been charged in connection with the murder of Umlazi Ward 88 councillor Sibusiso Maphumulo, who was killed on October 18.
A fourth accused, Nkosinathi Mbambo, who has also been charged with the murder, made his first appearance yesterday. 
Maphumulo was seated in his vehicle, parked in Mgobhozi Road in V Section, Umlazi, when gunmen opened fire. He died at the scene.

Yesterday a large crowd of people gathered at the court for the case, some wearing ANC regalia.
Mthokozisi’s advocate, Simphiwe Mlotshwa, said his client wished to apply for bail and claimed that he had been assaulted in custody.
However, the matter was adjourned to next month for a bail application. All four men were remanded.

This is the second incident in the past few months in which an ANC councillor has been implicated in the murder of a colleague.
Ward 10 councillor Nkosinathi Gambu in Msunduzi Municipality and Skhanyiso Zimu, Sfiso Mbelu, Mlungisi Zimu, Ayanda Ngubane and Gift Zungu are facing charges in connection with the murder of former ANC councillor Musawenkosi Mchunu.
