Durban - Bollywood’s glamour couple, Kareena Kapoor and Saif Ali Khan, are enjoying a South African summer holiday in the Mother City, mixing leisure with work, but Durban fans want them to come to the eastern shores.
Kapoor got social media abuzz with her Insta shots of her family, including her son Taimur, against the scenic mountain backdrop.

On Thursday, the couple celebrated Taimur’s second birthday in the city.
Kapoor, known as much for her fashion sense as her movie roles, posted pictures of herself in a white summer dress and hair band, while her husband, also a Bollywood A-list actor, sported summer shorts.
Ali Khan reportedly told Indian media that they were in Cape Town to shoot an advert for a luggage brand.

Durban and Gauteng fans were quick to ask the couple to visit their cities as well.
One Instagrammer @aysh_akoonjee said: “Gorgeous Couple! Do come to Durban as well, we have some stunning beaches and great weather!”
@keshr17 said: “awww adorable... I hope you guys are traveling to Joburg”.

Kareena’s manager, Poonam Damania, stylist Yianni Tsapatori and a host of fan pages have shared photos of the family together, with their son stealing attention for one of the most stylish babies in Bollywood.
