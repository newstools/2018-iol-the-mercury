Durban - Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs MEC Nomusa Dube-Ncube has placed the troubled Endumeni Municipality under administration.
Endumeni has faced political challenges and only recently appointed a mayor and a speaker. The municipal manager is on suspension.

Opposition parties welcomed the move by Dube-Ncube. 
“There was instability in the senior management and there are quite a number of allegations of maladministration and corruption,” said DA councillor Isri Bedassi. 
ANC councillor and speaker Lucky Khumalo said there was too much “corruption” in the council and there had even been a break in at the municipal manager’s office with documents stolen.

Dube-Ncube recently tabled a forensic investigation report that uncovered rampant corruption at the municipality, including payments made to individuals on the pretext they were donations to religious organisations, but these did not exist.
There were also fraudulent subsistence and travel claims; the irregular appointment of service providers; and excessive and irregular expenditure on security services.
“The council was given 21 days within which to process the report and advise the MEC of remedial action. This has not happened and the report is said to be missing,” said Dube-Ncube.

She said she wanted all those implicated in the corrupt dealings that crippled the municipality to be arrested and barred from dealing with public money. 
IFP leader Blessed Gwala said Dube-Ncube’s actions were not meant to save the municipality but were an extension of a campaign by her and the ANC to disrupt the functioning of IFP-run councils. 
“We know many other IFP-run municipalities are being discussed with the intention to make them as dysfunctional as Endumeni,” he said. 

The administrator is yet to be announced.
“We are urging Endumeni council to co-operate with the administrator in the best interests of the people of this municipality,” said Dube-Ncube.
