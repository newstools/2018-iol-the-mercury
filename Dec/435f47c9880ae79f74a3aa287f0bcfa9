Durban - Shattered family and friends of the 8-year-old boy who died when a goalpost fell on him during a soccer match on Friday night said their final goodbyes to him in an emotional send-off on Sunday.
Kiyan Singh of uMhlanga died during a match between Riverside and Juventus football clubs’ junior teams on Friday night.

Kiyan was a member of Juventus FC and it is believed he was standing near the goalpost on the sidelines of the Riverside soccer pitch when heavy winds caused the goalpost to fall over.
SAPS spokesperson Nqobile Gwala said an inquest was being investigated by Durban North police.
Netcare 911 spokesperson Shawn Herbst said the paramedics responded to reports of the child sustaining head injuries at around 6pm on Friday night.

“A full advanced life-support resuscitation was initiated but the child’s injuries were too severe and he was sadly declared deceased on the scene,” Herbst said.
Kiyan’s funeral took place late Sunday afternoon at the Claire Estate crematorium.
His father, Sahil Singh, said he was not ready to speak about the incident.

A close family member said they were “completely devastated” and struggling to come to terms with what happened.
