Durban - A 14-year-old Durban boy is in intensive care after he fell several metres off Karkloof Falls and suffered serious injuries on Wednesday.
This comes after Howick couple André and Mar-Louise Pretorius slipped off a cliff at the falls in October and are still recovering from their injuries.

Reshnee Beekrum, marketing manager for Mediclinic Hospital in Pietermaritzburg, said the boy’s mother did not want to be interviewed but allowed the hospital to release information.
“The boy is in intensive care under the care of a neurosurgeon, who is still running tests and investigations based on his injuries,” said Beekrum. 
Mike Myers, spokesperson for security company MobiClaw 911, said the sister of their client, Michael Sloane, reported seeing someone fall off the Karkloof Falls.

“She called him in shock, not knowing what to do. He immediately activated his Mobi-Claw 911 panic button,” said Meyers.
According to Myers the incident was at the Woodhouse Falls in the Karkloof region and was attended to by police search and rescue PMB, ER24 EMS and Netcare 911. 
Russel Meiring, ER24 spokesperson, said paramedics arrived on the scene shortly after 2pm. 

“Paramedics found the young boy lying on some rocks at the bottom of the falls,” he said.
He said they made their way down to the boy and quickly assessed him. 
“They found that he had sustained numerous injuries and was in a serious condition,” said Meiring. 

Meiring said the boy was treated for his injuries and provided with pain-relief medication. 
“After treatment, a private medical helicopter landed near the patient and, after a short time, airlifted the boy to Mediclinic Pietermaritzburg,” he said. 
He added that the details surrounding the incident are not yet known.
