Durban - The two men, who were arrested at Kingsmead Stadium during the Mzansi Super League match on Friday, were on an international list of alleged match-fixing offenders, who are banned from attending any cricket game in the world.
Spokesperson for Cricket South Africa, Koketso Gaofetoge confirmed the men were on the list, although they bought tickets for the luxury King's hospitality suite in the stadium.

According to the men's attorney, Roy Singh, the two businessmen from London had been in the country for business and extended their stay for a holiday.
They are aged 34 and 35.
Singh said they had purchased their tickets for the cricket match, between Durban Heat and Jozi Stars, and were in their suite when security officials approached them.

Singh said the men denied any involvement in match-fixing or illegal sports betting.
“They were first confronted by Cricket South Africa officials and then the police were brought in. It was all blown out of proportion,” Singh said.
He said the men were initially told they would face charges for match-fixing and illegal sports betting, but the charges were later “watered down” to trespassing.

“They were taken to Durban Central Station and held in custody for a short while. I don't have any more information right now but I will be meeting with them (today),” Singh said.
Police spokesperson, Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane confirmed the men were released on R500 bail but could not say when they would appear in court.
