Durban - The R1.6billion Tsogo Sun has spent reinventing Suncoast is the group’s largest single investment in a property and “a testament to its confidence in Durban”.
That is what Glenn Joseph, the chief operating officer of Tsogo Sun Gaming, told the 900 guests who partied the night away yesterday to celebrate the grand relaunch of the beachfront complex.

When Suncoast opened 16 years ago at a cost of R1.4bn, it was the biggest investment on the Durban beachfront.
The whole complex has been refurbished and the space increased to 48012m² - the equivalent of five rugby fields - to offer facilities for a diverse audience.

Uniquely located at the verge of the Indian Ocean on the northern end of Durban’s Golden Mile, Suncoast has been reinvented at a cost of R1.6 billion, providing Durban with a world-class attraction for both local and international visitors. From floor to ceiling and length to length, the entire property has been refurbished. Floor space has increased to a total of 48 012m² – the equivalent of five rugby fields – with facilities carefully planned to deliver on the needs of a diverse audience, from families, to casino patrons to movie-lovers to theatre-goers and the corporate market.

The investment would help Durban and KwaZulu-Natal remain a leader in tourism and entertainment, said Suncoast.
The redevelopment took two years and was finished in record time ahead of the original April 2019 completion date, said Suncoast executive director Mike Dowsley.

Finishing before schedule while operating 24 hours a day was an enormous achievement and testimony to the teamwork of the 57 contractors and their teams and Suncoast’s 1800 staff.
Dowsley said the redevelopment would mean more jobs, “directly and indirectly”. 

There is now more of everything: more restaurants, parking bays (3600) and facilities. There are 10 new eateries (to total 21) with 2817 seats, and three more to come.
A Barnyard Theatre opens next week.
Last night’s opening was held in the new dome-shaped Globe multi-purpose venue, which can accommodate 2200.

The casino floor has been refurbished and the slot machines have been increased from 1600 to 1850, while four new tables have taken the number to 71.
