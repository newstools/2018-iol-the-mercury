Durban - KwaZulu-Natal Health MEC Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo has launched the 2018 Festive Season Readiness Plan at Amajuba District, and given his assurance that his Department is ready to deal with the expected influx of Christmas holidaymakers.  
Accompanied by officials from the KZN Department of Transport, as well as members of the Road Traffic Inspectorate, MEC Dhlomo oversaw a road block on the N2 highway between Ladysmith and Newcastle. He handed out flyers with health-related information, interacted with motorists, and urged them to ensure that their vehicles are roadworthy, and exercise caution on the road. MEC Dhlomo also showcased ambulances that will be stationed at strategic points, in order to be able to respond to emergencies.

“We started in the morning with the patrols and road blockages, stopping vehicles to check their road worthiness, the state of the driver, the passengers and everything to do with road safety. There were a few arrests of those who were found in violation of the road rules by, among other things, not wearing a seat belt, and not having all the documentation for driving the vehicle. We did not find any people who were driving under the influence of alcohol, or whose cars were not road worthy. We are quite happy about that," he said.
Dr Dhlomo says the Department of Health is ready to support all those individuals who may get involved in car accidents.
“It is very important to know that we have ambulances on hotspots and high accident zones, as identified by the Road Traffic Officers, so that we can support them and find people involved in accidents, and take them to health facilities as quickly as possible. Our province is a tourist destination for many South Africans, as well as international tourists, so we want to demonstrate and give that sense of comfort to citizens that we will be available to support the individuals who may get involved in accidents on the roads," Dhlomo said.

The festive season safety strategy is anchored on, among others, the following pillars:
 •             Integration of all law enforcement agencies;
•             Partnership with key stakeholders – SANTACO, the bus industry, freight and   logistics and other stakeholders including the Interfaith;

•             Traffic police visibility and 24/7 visibility in hot spot areas;
•             Interaction with road users, including drivers and passengers; and
•             Mobilisation of all sectors of the community to work for peace, stability and ensure a crime-free festive season.

MEC Dhlomo also urged the public to consider donating blood as demand for it is traditionally high and the supply low at this time of the year.
