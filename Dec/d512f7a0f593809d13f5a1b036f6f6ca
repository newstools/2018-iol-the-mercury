Durban - KwaZulu-Natal Health MEC Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo says abstinence and family planning need to be promoted among teenagers.
Dhlomo was speaking at Prince Mshiyeni Memorial and RK Khan Hospitals on Tuesday after the province welcomed 106 babies born on Christmas Day. 

The youngest mother of the Christmas Day babies was 16 years old. She gave birth to a boy at Queen Nandi Memorial Hospital.
There were 63 boys and 43 girls born by 9am at healthcare facilities throughout the province on Christmas Day. Two 17-year-old mothers gave birth to a boy and a girl at Prince Myshiyeni and at St Apollinaris in Harry Gwala District, respectively. 
Eshowe Hospital welcomed Balungisa Nzuza’s twins, a boy and a girl.

Reflecting on the day, Dhlomo said that the department had recorded at least three teenage mothers of Christmas Day babies. 
 “The one who is 16 years old, it means she fell pregnant when she was 15 years old. 
“Now, that worries us because a significant number of maternal deaths come from teenagers because at that age, you’re simply just not ready to become a mother,” he said. 

Dhlomo added that the department was “worried” because some of the girls tended to hide their pregnancies until it was too late.
The department also recorded that almost all the province’s hospitals had Home Affairs offices and that the babies could be registered before they left the facilities.
“We want to encourage nursing sisters to keep on reminding mothers that when the day comes for them to deliver, they must please carry along their ID and that of their husband or boyfriend. 

“That will go a long way to ensure early birth registration because, for everybody, a birth certificate and later the ID, becomes part of your life,” Dhlomo said.
