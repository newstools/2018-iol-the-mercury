Durban - One person was killed and six injured when a retaining wall collapsed in Groutville yesterday.
The iLembe district municipality confirmed that the collapse occurred at one of its projects and said it would investigate.

Contract workers had been laying a sewer pipe near the Luthuli Museum when the wall next to their site collapsed on to them.
The name of the worker who died was not released yesterday as the family still had to be informed. 
Netcare 911’s Shawn Herbst said paramedics responded to the accident shortly after midday. 

“Reports from the scene indicated that seven construction workers were buried under rubble when a wall collapsed on to them.”
He said firefighters and paramedics worked to free the patients.
“One patient, a 28-year-old man, was critical and due to the seriousness of his injuries, advanced life support resuscitation was initiated.

“Sadly, the worker succumbed to his injuries and was declared dead at the scene,” he said.
Mayor Siduduzo Gumede, who went to the scene, said he was shocked by what he saw. “When I got there the situation was bad. We will engage the main contractor to find out what happened. 
“From the information we have so far, the workers were laying a pipe beneath a retaining wall and it collapsed on to them, burying them. We are still waiting for the consultants to give us a detailed briefing,” he said. 

He added that the safety of workers was important to the municipality.
“No one expected this - it seems that the safety of the workers had not been prioritised here,” said Gumede.
“We are pained about what happened. This is a municipal project and we would like to convey our condolences to the family who lost their loved one,” he said.
