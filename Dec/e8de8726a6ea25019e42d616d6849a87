Durban - Mohammed Ebrahim, the man charged with the murder of Miguel Louw, will spend the next seven days in custody. 
Ebrahim was officially arrested for Miguel's death at the Durban Magistrate's Court on Wednesday morning, where he was appearing in connection with Miguel's kidnap in July this year. 


 




Initially, Ebrahim had been charged with kidnap after he was believed to have been the last person seen with the Sydenham youngster. Ebrahim also faced a charge of theft as he was allegedly found in possession of Miguel's birth certificate and other documents. 

Miguel was last seen on July 17. At the time, he was with Ebrahim and the two were spotted at a local eatery, not far from the primary school that Miguel attended. 
It is alleged that Miguel then boarded a taxi. That was the last time he was seen in the vicinity of Sydenham.
An extensive search was launched for the boy, which panned across the province. 

Almost two months later, his decomposing body was found, buried in a shallow grave in Phoenix. At the time, it was established that Miguel's body was buried just metres away from Ebrahim's home. 
While seated at the court, Ebrahim was approached by Warrant Officer Rajan Govender and informed of the charge against him. He was then taken to the Durban Central Police Station where he was formally charged. 
While Ebrahim's bail still stands in the kidnap matter, the murder charge supersedes the kidnapping charge. He will remain in custody and appear in court again on December 12.
