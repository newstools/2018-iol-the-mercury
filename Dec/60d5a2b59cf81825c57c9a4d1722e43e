“Yanga’s vocal prowess is unmatched, and she is loved by the people Cape. We could not think of a more fitting addition to the line-up, and can’t wait for her to impress the more than 15 000 Capetonians who will attend the city’s premier music event,” said Kfm 94.5 Programming Manager, Stephen Werner.
Werner added: “Yanga is part of Cape Town’s musical triple threat along with Craig Lucas and Paxton, who have both previously set the Huawei KDay stage on fire.
