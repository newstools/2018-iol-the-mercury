Durban - La Lucia schoolgirl Abby Lloyd had her lovely long hair lopped off yesterday, and all for the love of a total stranger.
When Abby, 9, heard that cancer patients who undergo chemotherapy often lose their hair and then needed wigs, she decided to grow her hair and donate it.

“My friend told me that you could make wigs from real hair and I decided to grow my hair because I wanted to help someone,” she said.
It took her just over a year to grow her hair from shoulder length to right down her back - the minimum 25cm needed - and yesterday she visited the hairdresser to have her hair cut.
Her ponytail was then put in a zip-lock bag to be donated to Cansa KZN, which provides the wig service for patients.

“I’m very proud of Abby for doing this,” said her mother Heidi Lambson.
Lisa Strydom, the divisional manager for Cansa KZN, said Abby’s gesture was “amazing.”
Durban hairstylist and wig-maker Janine Prinsloo, who has a partnership with Cansa KZN, said Abby’s hair would be combined with other donations to make a wig.

“It takes between nine and 12 ponytails to make one wig. You have to colour match the hair and make sure the textures are the same,” she said.
Prinsloo carries out pre-booked consultations with patients at Cansa KZN’s offices, 619 Umbilo Road, Durban, every Tuesday and also provides WhatsApp consultations for patients in other locations.
A real hair wig hair costs R950 (excluding colouring), but Prinsloo said that synthetic wigs, which she also styles and can colour to individual preferences, are very popular, as they require less maintenance and are cheaper.
