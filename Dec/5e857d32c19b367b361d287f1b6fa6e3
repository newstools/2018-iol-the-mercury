Durban - A Pietermaritzburg family is still searching for the body of their 22-year-old son after it is believed he drowned on Tuesday morning in North Beach.
Diren Chetty was on holiday in Durban with friends when the incident happened. 

His uncle Preggy Nair said Chetty and his friends were at a party at his friend’s flat in Berea. He said he believes it was Chetty’s idea to go to the beach to watch the sunrise at around 4.30am.

 


“He went with his two friends. Diren decided to go further into the ocean. His friends said he dove in but never came up,” Nair said.
According to Nair, one of the friends ran to the nearby police station to call for help. However, it was too early and lifeguards were not on duty.

“At this moment we are just waiting. The authorities said that if the body surfaces, they will contact us,” Nair said.
