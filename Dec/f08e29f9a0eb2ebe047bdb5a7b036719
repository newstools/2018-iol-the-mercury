Durban - Some Durban metro police officers are allegedly reporting for duty in civilian clothing as the department faces a critical shortage of police uniform items.
Officers who spoke to The Mercury on condition of anonymity said basic uniform items such as trousers, shirts and boots were not in stock.

“That is why you see many of us wearing old uniforms. Some of these have been patched up because they are worn out. The auxiliary constables are supposed to be wearing grey pants and white shirts, yet you will find them wearing two-piece overalls due to the shortage,” said one officer.
While officers said it was a crisis, the spokesperson for the department, Parboo Sewpersad, said it was not true that some officers had not been issued uniforms in two years.
“Uniform items in stock are issued almost daily. Items that are out of stock, are ordered as per supply chain management processes,” he said.

The Mercury understands that the city has for over a year not appointed a service provider to supply the uniform items.
Sewpersad said this was because suppliers were not conforming to the specifications for 100% South African products, but he said the shortage was not affecting operations.
A source blamed the shortage on poor supply management.

Joe Mabaso of Samwu said the problem had persisted for a long time. 
“Yes they do not have uniforms. Management is aware of the issue.”
Police would not give a breakdown of stockholding of uniforms.
