Durban - Some areas of Durban North have been without electricity since before Christmas after power cables were struck by lightning.
Residents said their complaints could not even be registered as calls to the municipality’s call centre were not being answered. 

Keith Emmerich said the electricity at his Lynford Place home in Athlone went off in the early hours of yesterday morning. Due to the intense heat, he said, he has lost thousands of rands worth of food that went bad.
“As with any family we bought a whole lot for the festive season. Now we have to throw it all away because it has gone bad. I have called the call centre since the early hours of the morning but no one has answered as yet,” he said late yesterday afternoon. 
Emmerich said he resorted to going to the municipal offices to lodge the fault and enquire when electricity would be restored to his home. 

“When I got there, there were at least seven others with the same complaint. One man was in tears saying he hasn’t had electricity since before Christmas and could not open his business and lost out on income.” 
When The Mercury called the call centre, an automated response notified customers that the city was not load shedding but it was aware that a number of areas were left without power. The automated response also said that workers were in those areas to repair the problems. 
Msawakhe Mayisela from the eThekwini Municipality said the city was aware of the issues and apologised to residents for the inconvenience caused. He said the power issues in Lynford Place was due to an act of nature and workers were working to speedily sort out the issue. 

“We have teams out to fix the problems. With regards to complaints about the call centre, as far as I know, the call centre lines are working normally but we will investigate the issues,” he said.
