Durban - Metro Police have joined hands with the United Nations in condemning the use of a cellphone when driving. 
 

 On Tuesday, Metro Police officers, in partnership with the UN, officially launched their No Texting & Driving campaign. 

 

 Metro Police spokesperson, Senior Superintendent Parboo Sewpersad, said Durban was the first city to partner with the UN for the campaign. 

 

 "When you see the results of texting and driving, you will wish you never drove with your cellphone near you," he said. 

 

 He said the issue of texting and driving has become a world issue. 

 

 "At a conference that we attended in Johannesburg, we came up with the initiative to unite against this issue. When you look at the results from the crashes that are caused by texting and driving, they are horrific. If you have to compare the statistics, you find that there are more road crashes caused by texting and driving than drinking and driving," Sewpersad said. 

 

 He urged residents to refrain from using their cellphones while driving. 

 

 "Rather use your phone's bluetooth capabilities instead. Do not text and drive," he said.
