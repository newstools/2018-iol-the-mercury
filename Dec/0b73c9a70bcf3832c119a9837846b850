Durban - The South African National Blood Service has asked South Africans to come forward and donate blood, as stocks remain critically low.
Sfiso Khoza, the regional marketing manager for SANBS, said KZN currently has just 184 units which translate to stock of just under two days.

“Nationally we are sitting on three days and ideally we should be on five days,” he said. Khoza said he hoped South Africans would go out and donate blood.
Khoza said the province may be forced to start importing from other provinces. SANBS aims to collect 3000 units of blood per day nationally and 500 units for KwaZulu-Natal to ensure there is a sufficient supply of blood to the healthcare sector.
Health MEC Sibongiseni Dhlomo, who donated blood last week, said it was of concern that blood stocks were so low and urged members of the public to donate blood. 

Dhlomo donated his pint of blood at the SANBS depot at uMlazi's Megacity shopping centre.
