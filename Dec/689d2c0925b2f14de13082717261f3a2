Durban - Former Durban Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive Dumile Cele is part of a new organisation that wants to tackle Durban’s problems.
City Story is a network of individuals from different spheres of life who want to empower each other to bring about a powerful collaboration to spark remarkable change in the city. 

The group is made up of NPOs, business people, religious groups, academia, eThekwini municipality and government. Cele said the group came about three years ago. 
“It’s basically a group of us who are passionate about seeing Durban become everything it can be. We want to propel Durban forward by way of up-scale and impact,” Cele said.

City Story are using New York city in the US as an inspiration and a business model. Cele said at one point the Big Apple was riddled with drugs and crime.
“Now it has boosted itself to one of the top 10 best cities in the world. It is going to be a journey but it’s only those who live in our city that will be able to make the change,” she said. 
She said people needed to own the process and use their gifts and resources to bring about change. 

A video made by the group which is presented by Russell Curtis and Mphume Mkhize went viral earlier this month.
Cele said the group’s video came after an expose by MNet’s Carte Blanche revealed several issues that Durban was grappling with, including drug usage, prostitution, homelessness and litter. 
She said the Carte Blanche feature on the city’s problems only challenged them to fast-track their turnaround strategy.

“We are calling on other organisations, individuals to come together. We are strength in numbers. This is an organised collaborative effort toward dealing with Durban’s problems.” 
In the video the group launched their appeal to others to join in their action plan for a better Durban. 
“If you are tired of turning a blind eye to the challenges out there or city faces or just don’t know how to get involved in making a difference we want to invite you to be a part of our community of courage and together take action. 

“Anyone can join in,” Mkhize says in the video. 
City Story has also invited Carte Blanche to return to the streets they filmed in four years promising a different image.
