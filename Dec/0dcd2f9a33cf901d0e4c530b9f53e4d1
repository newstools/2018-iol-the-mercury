Johannesburg - President Cyril Ramaphosa has announced Advocate Shamila Batohi as the new National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP)
 

 Batohi will be tasked with bringing stability to the prosecuting body.

 

 "The National Director of Public Prosecutions occupies a vital position in our democracy, and makes an essential contribution to upholding the rule of law and ensuring the efficiency and integrity of law enforcement," said Ramaphosa. 
 
Tuesday’s announcement comes after five nominees for the post were handed to Ramaphosa for consideration after they were shortlisted by an advisory panel he set up, chaired by Energy Minister Jeff Radebe.

No NDPP has finished their 10-year tenure since the dawn of democracy, and political pressure has been placed at the heart of the resignations or removal of those who previously headed the NPA.

The five candidates were Batohi, Simphiwe Mlotshwa, Rodney de Kock, Andrea Johnson and Siyabulela Mapoma. They have all worked or are still working for the NPA.

Mxolisi Nxasana, who was installed permanently to the post in 2013, was given a golden handshake by former president Jacob Zuma in 2015, which the Constitutional Court declared illegal and set aside this year, including the appointment of his replacement by Shaun Abrahams.

Ramaphosa was ordered to appoint a new NPA head within 90 days, which would effectively be by December 19.

After Abrahams' removal, deputy NDPP Silas Ramaite was appointed as the acting NPA head.
