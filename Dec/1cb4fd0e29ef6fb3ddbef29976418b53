Durban - The Minister of Water and Sanitation Gugile Nkwinti has appointed a new board for Mhlathuze Water.
Mhlathuze Water has been without a permanent board since the expiry of the previous board’s term of office in 2016.

“The 11-member board is chaired by Thabi Agatha Shange, who has the relevant experience and expertise including in the audit, water management and finance fields to name but a few,” the organisation said.
The other board members are Silas Hlophe (deputy chairperson), Purshottamma Reddy, Nica Gevers, Mosidi Makgae, Musa Moses Xulu, Bonginkosi Mshengu, Amita Badul, Nothando Mkhize, Gloria Biyela and Petros Zikalala.
Speaking at the board’s inaugural meeting, Shange said: “Mhlathuze Water is an institution that boasts immense talent and ours is to provide the necessary leadership, guidance and oversight to the executive committee in order for the utility to function at its optimum and within the realms of good corporate governance.” 

Nkwinti expressed confidence in the new board, saying it would bring stability to Mhlathuze Water. 
“After a rigorous selection process, we are pleased to welcome these board members to Mhlathuze Water. 
“Their diverse professional backgrounds and skills will no doubt set Mhlathuze Water on a path to excellence and enable the water utility to execute its founding mandate of bulk water delivery with a renewed vigour,” he said. 

Nkwinti commended interim chief executive Mthokozisi Duze for playing a dual role, as chief executive and accounting authority, for the past two years. 
“I commend Duze for holding the fort in the absence of a board and ensuring that the utility continued to achieve its stated objectives of bulk water delivery.”
