Durban - Kwazulu-Natal MEC for Human Settlements and Public Works Ravi Pillay officially opened the Human Settlements Youth Summit at Elangeni Hotel in Durban on Monday morning. 
He introduced the provincial government's youth development strategy where young people are targeted to benefit from construction and infrastructure related opportunities.

The main purpose of the Summit is to provide role-players with a platform and opportunity to connect and collaborate around issues involving young entrepreneurs. It aims to give momentum to President Cyril Ramaphosa’s call to reform the economy with youth at its core.
During his State of the Nation Address earlier this year, Ramaphosa said, “Our task, as South Africans, is to seize this moment of hope and renewal, and to work together to ensure that it makes a meaningful difference in the lives of our people”.
It is within this spirit that the Human Settlements Youth Summit aims to inspire, empower and connect youth in the human settlements value chain.

Delegates at the Summit will discuss the challenges that youth face in the human settlements sector and ways to best address these challenges. Focussed discussions will centre around; business opportunities for young entrepreneurs in the human settlements sector, legal and policy landscape, procurement processes / sub-contracting and material supply, compliance matters and funding, business and administrative support to youth-owned businesses. 
It is expected that a model for enterprise supplier development programme and an implementation plan for increased youth economic participation in human settlements sector will stem from the discussions at the Summit.
The Summit is set to wrap up on Tuesday.
