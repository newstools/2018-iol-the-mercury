Durban - Abahlali baseMjondolo has launched a scathing attack on the eThekwini Municipality, accusing it of violence, intimidation and the murder of activists.
The shackdwellers’ movement and Numsa marched to the Durban City Hall yesterday against landlessness, political marginalisation and violence.

“We demand the president establish a credible, independent commission of inquiry into the killing of Abahlali and other activists,” read their memorandum.
In May, S’fiso Ngcobo chairperson of Abahlali in eKukhanyeni was shot dead outside his home. The president, Sbu Zikode, reportedly went into hiding after receiving death threats. 

They have also alleged intimidation by councillors and had verbal exchanges with eThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede.
Ethekwini mayoral spokesperson Mthunzi Gumede said the claims were groundless. 

“Since the start of the year, the mayor has engaged Abahlali and we remain optimistic that we will eventually have a progressive relationship.”
Abahlali leader Mqapheli Bonono said they were not happy that not a single senior leader had availed themselves to take the memorandum.

“We had wanted someone from the national office of Bheki Cele, but we had to give the memorandum to a provincial brigadier. This is very disappointing,” he said.
Numsa regional secretary Mbuso Ngubane said they supported Abahlali because they touched on issues affecting their members. 

“It concerns us that whenever Abahlali members confront corruption, they are threatened and even killed,” said Ngubane.
