Durban - An Amanzimtoti teenager’s dream to become a pilot was given a boost yesterday when she got the chance to fly in a light aircraft from Virginia Airport.
Megan Holder’s dream of becoming a pilot was put on hold three years ago when she went for a routine school medical exam and discovered that she had a kidney problem.

Megan, 17, was later diagnosed with Job’s Syndrome, a rare condition that affects the immune system.
She said she loves flying and, despite her health struggles, still wants to be a pilot.

“It’s my passion and it’s something that I keep fighting for because I want to do it and show everyone that no matter how hard the battles, you should never give up on your dreams,” said Megan.
Megan, who has to repeat Grade 11 due to her condition and the desire to get high marks, explained that her health took a dive in Grade 10.

She thanked Eagle Air Flight School for making her day “amazing” and said she was now motivated to keep going.
Percy Rudman, of Eagle Air, said they decided to offer Megan the chance to fly after her mother contacted them on Facebook and shared Megan’s story.

“It’s a small contribution in order to put something back into aviation,” he said.
