Durban - A tattoo on his right forearm has linked a suspect to a shooting that claimed the lives of two security guards in Soweto earlier this month. 
  

 Yesterday morning, the tattooed suspect and his accomplice were killed by police in a shootout at a shack in Clermont. 
 
  
Lindokuhle Cebekhulu, 24 and Mbuyiselo Mthonti, 26, had been on the run after they shot dead Eric Ngobese and Boykie Moyo at the Maponya Mall.

The shooting was recorded on high-definition cameras mounted in a security vehicle, and the video was widely circulated on social media. 

The duo’s run ended in a “rundown” shack in Ndundulu, Clermont, when members of crime intelligence and Joburg detectives pounced in an early morning raid.

The Mercury has learned that law enforcement units had travelled to Nkandla to question the parents of the pair, who could not provide information on their whereabouts. The search moved to Clermont, near Pinetown, where they were found.

During the raid, one suspect is said to have shot at the police with a .38 Special revolver. 

Neighbours said they had no clue the two “quiet young men” living in the shack next to them were wanted. They had arrived about a week ago.

National police spokesperson Vish Naidoo said the police had worked tirelessly over the past two weeks to track down the culprits. 

“A handgun recovered at the scene will be sent for ballistic testing to establish if it was the weapon used in the killing of the guards,” he said.
