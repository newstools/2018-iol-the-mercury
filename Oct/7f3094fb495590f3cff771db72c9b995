Durban - A veil of secrecy surrounds the identities of a group of men, arrested for a spate of bomb threats across the city. 
Today, the men are due to appear in the Verulam Magistrate's Court, however the media was barred from entering the courtroom. 

 Members of the media were told that the ruling issued by the magistrate is only for today's appearance and posters have been put up on the doors of the court so those outside could not see what was happening inside.
