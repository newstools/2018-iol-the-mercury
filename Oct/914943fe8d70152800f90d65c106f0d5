Durban - The 43-year-old man accused of kidnapping Miguel Louw earlier this year, is due back in court on December 5. 
Mohammed Ebrahim appeared in the Durban Magistrate’s Court this morning. Despite a murder charge being opened once Miguel's body was found two months after his disappearance, Ebrahim has not been charged for murder. 

The court proceedings today was anything but “normal” after Miguel’s grandmother, Arlene Louw, began screaming at Ebrahim as he stood in the dock.
After court, Ebrahim had to be escorted out of the building by police after he was sworn at by members of Miguel’s family.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
