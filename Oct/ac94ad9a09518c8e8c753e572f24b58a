Durban - A 10-year-old pianist from Durban was announced as the winner in the under 14 category of the SAMRO Hubert van der Spuy National Music Competition at the Hugo Lambrechts Music Centre in Parow last week.
Weien Amy Luo also won the Category Prize for Piano, the award for Most Promising Candidate of 10 Years and Younger, as well as the Leon Hartshorne Prize for being the highest achieving candidate of national SASMT members.

Luo said the week long competition - which ran from 24-28 September -  was an intense process of learning the competition pieces but she enjoyed all of it.
“The SAMRO music competition is my first national music competition. It’s a lifetime experience that I will forever benefit from,”said Luo.

Winning the competition was beyond Luo’s expectations but it is a dream come true. 
“I do believe you can reach your goal with your passion, hard work, and most importantly you must enjoy the process,” she said.

The 10-year-old was the only the successful applicant from Durban while Cape Town had 30 and Pretoria 26.
Luo entertained the audience with her technique and stage persona during her performances of James Wilding’s Water Nymphs, Haydn’s Sonata in F, HobXVI/23: 1, and Copland’s The Cat and the Mouse.

The young musician said she feels happy when she plays music.
As this year’s winner, Luo walked away with a gold medal and  R15 000, while her teacher Phillippa Greenwood received R2500.

In addition to her cash prizes, Luo won the opportunity to perform as a soloist during next year’s Hugo Lambrechts Concerto Festival, sponsored accommodation at the Welgemoed Manor for the opening of 2019’s National Music Competition, as well as an invitation to perform at the Oude Libertas Amphitheatre in Stellenbosch.
