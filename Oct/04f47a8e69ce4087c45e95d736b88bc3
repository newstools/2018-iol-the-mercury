Durban - The MEC for Transport, Community Safety and Liaison, Mxolisi Kaunda, hopped on a train from uMlazi to Durban with passengers to assess the stability of train operations after railway services resumed yesterday.
Railway services were suspended in the province after a large crowd of commuters vandalised the uMlazi Train Station and torched coaches, the uMlazi ticket office and staff vehicles parked near the station two weeks ago. 

At the time the damages were estimated at R8 million.
The Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) spokesperson, Zama Nomnganga, said in weekend media reports that the entity was intent on getting to the bottom of the incidents of vandalism and would be increasing security at train stations. 

Kaunda yesterday expressed satisfaction with the train services, saying the department was working closely with Prasa and the government to ensure operations were not disrupted again. 
He said it was unlikely that commuters had vandalised the station “as those who use the trains daily know the value of (the service)”.

Railway services in the Stanger corridor were still suspended as Prasa and Transnet were repairing infrastructure there. Kaunda said services in the North Coast should resume fully by the end of the month. 
“We also want to see these vandals brought to book for their actions,” he said.
