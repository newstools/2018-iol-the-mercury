DURBAN - A Joburg lawyer, originally from Ottawa near Verulam, is offering a reward for the return of a heavy old antique safe that was stolen from her mother’s home three months ago. 
Garene Maharaj said it was a family heirloom that her grandmother had brought to South Africa from India.

“It was so heavy that it took 12 strong men to carry it into my mother’s home. After they moved it the floor tiles were heavily scratched,” she said.
She said its loss in a burglary had left her elderly mother heartbroken. Her mother has since moved to Joburg.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
“All her jewellery was in it. These old people from India didn’t believe in keeping such things in banks,” said Maharaj.

She said Verulam police had taken fingerprints at the time and that the local security company Reaction Unit South Africa had visited locksmith shops in their investigations.
