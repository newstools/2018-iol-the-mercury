Durban - Officials from the KwaZulu-Natal Department of Education today paid a visit to a number of schools as hundreds of pupils sat to write their English exam. 
Speaking at the visit, the MEC said they are hoping that no schools in the province will have zero pass rates. 

MEC Mthandeni Dlungwane noted that there were three schools in the province that achieved a dismal zero % pass rate and this year, the department was hoping that this would not be the case. 
Dlungwane visited several schools in Umlazi Township and Ndwedwe area to check on the progress of the exams.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

He visited Vukuzakhe High School in Umlazi where more than 200 pupils from four schools were being accommodated after their schools were damaged during service delivery protests in Ngonyameni.
“We have done all to make sure the pupils do well, through winter classes, camps and Saturday classes. Last  year we had three schools that achieved zero % and the aim is to eliminate those schools. We also want to decrease the number of schools that achieved less than 60%," he said.
