Durban - A race row has erupted between the DA and KwaZulu-Natal Premier Willies Mchunu.
DA provincial leader Zwakele Mncwango has accused Mchunu of making an “anti-Indian” remark during a Heritage Day celebrations debate, but, in turn, the DA has been accused of racism and peddling a falsehood.

Mncwango stated that Mchunu had said: “The Indians are not part of South Africa.” 
He provided an audio clip where Mchunu supposedly made the remark but it is not contained in the clip.

Mchunu’s comments came after a DA MPL had been delivering remarks on the need to protect Indian subsistence fishermen. 
The speech - which was later posted on DA MPL Sharon Hoosen’s Facebook page - highlights the plight of Indian fishermen, stating that despite the end of apartheid, they had not received any redress from the government.

It said since 1994, the situation for these communities had worsened and that if Mchunu’s government failed to protect these people, it would not differ from the apartheid government.
In the recorded clip, Mchunu fired back: “I don’t think we will support your view, it’s a ‘minority front’ view at the expense of everyone else. 

“You tell us about the history of Indian people who were brought to South Africa, which is true, and you claim land for them as if no people were removed from that land. 
“Don’t distort history. History is clear. If you came here, from Europe, India or anywhere else, you would have found people on this land.”

Mncwango said they expected an apology. 
ANC MPL and Human Settlements MEC Ravi Pillay said: “He (Mchunu) was responding to the racist approach of the DA suggesting they have exclusive rights to this issue, that the laws were racially motivated when the laws of fishing apply to everyone.” 

Provincial government spokesperson Mandla Msomi said remarks attributed to Mchunu were baseless. 
“Nowhere in the clip provided by the DA leader does Mchunu utter the words attributed to him.”
