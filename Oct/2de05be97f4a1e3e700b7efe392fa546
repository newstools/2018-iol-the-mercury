Durban - Pietermaritzburg magistrate Ashin Singh has denied any misconduct in his interactions with attorneys acting for the men accused of killing ANC activist Musawenkosi “Qashana” Mchunu.
The bail hearing for the six accused was yesterday again postponed in the Pietermaritzburg Magistrate’s Court. 

Magistrate Sello Maboee - who took over the case from Singh, who recused himself on Friday - postponed the matter to October 23.
Singh’s recusal came after the State brought a 16-page formal application in the matter, saying the magistrate was allegedly seen talking to lawyers of the accused. 
He was also accused of communicating with a relative of two suspects. 

Speaking to The Mercury yesterday, Singh said the document included pictures of his wife’s car. 
“I don’t know what that has to do with the case, but they have put mine and my family’s lives at risk. You can rest assured this is not the end of the case,” Singh said.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
Before recusing himself, Singh made an order in court that the National Director of Public Prosecutions should investigate the chief prosecutor, senior public prosecutor and State prosecutor for their conduct in the matter. 

Mchunu was shot dead at his home in May by unknown gunmen.
