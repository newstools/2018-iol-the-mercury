Durban - The eThekwini Small Enterprise Development Agency (Seda) office could close because it has run out of funds.
Workers at the agency said salaries had not been paid for more than five months and the office had run out of essentials such as paper.

Seda-eThekwini, according to its chief executive, is the biggest agency in the country and sees more than 1000 clients a month. The centre provides support and training to small and emerging businesses. 
Protas Madlala, the chief executive of Seda-eThekwini, confirmed the situation.
“There are 17 permanent workers (at Seda-eThekwini) and 10 interns. All these people are affected but, besides those, we have service providers like security guards and cleaners, some of whom are not receiving a cent,” he said.

Madlala said he had tried everything he could, including taking out personal loans, to pay workers and keep the lights on.
He said the main problem was that a contract with Seda-National was not being renewed.
The Seda national entity falls under the Department of Small Business Development and is independent of Seda-eThekwini. 

However, it had funded Seda-eThekwini to the tune of about R3.6 million annually, he said.
When approached for comment yesterday, the Seda national office said there was no funding agreement between the two offices. It said it may provide funding to Seda-eThekwini when there was a service agreement.
“Therefore, the two may agree on a service level (SLA) agreement for services to be rendered, partially funded by Seda-National and carried out by Seda-eThekwini. The SLA is of useful assistance to both entities as it determines new funding terms and conditions the two institutions agree on,” Seda said in an emailed response.

Madlala did not rule out the possibilitby that the agency could soon close. 
The municipality also funds the centre, but the funds from the city are not enough to carry all the costs.
