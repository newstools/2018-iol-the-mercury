DURBAN - ON this day, 4 years ago, Orlando Pirates and Bafana Bafana goalkeeper Senzo Meyiwa was shot dead during a suspected house robbery at his girlfriend Kelly Khumalo‚Äôs house. 
Four years on, three police commissioners and two police ministers later, there are still no arrests.
It was a Sunday evening in 2014 at about 10pm¬†when news of Senzo's death was tweeted on social media.¬†
Senzo was mysteriously shot dead during a robbery at his musician girlfriend‚Äôs house in Vosloorus. He was with Kelly, her sister Zandi, Kelly‚Äôs mother, Kelly‚Äôs two children, Longwe Twala and his childhood friend Madlala at the time of the shooting. 
Zanokuhle Mbatha was arrested five days after the shooting and appeared in court. He was later freed on 11 November due to a lack of evidence.
At the time of his death, Senzo - who was married traditionally to Mandisa Mkhize - had been having an affair with Kelly Khumalo, with whom they share a baby together - Thingo. 
In the lead up to Senzo‚Äôs funeral in Durban, Sam Meyiwa - the father of the late goalkeeper - said Khumalo would not be welcome at the funeral. 
Khumalo and her baby Thingo, did not attend the funeral.

 Although there were a number of eyewitnesses at the time of the murder, the police could not find the killer and the case was then filed as a cold case.#Senzomeyiwa cannot be classified as a "Cold case" pic.twitter.com/4VLcIEZ1u6

Meanwhile, Senzo‚Äôs father Sam, who suffered a mild stroke in August, was not in a position to speak on Friday.
He had alleged in February that policemen had been bribed to not make any arrests pertaining to Senzo‚Äôs killers.
"It is clear that someone has been bribing police not to arrest anyone for my son's murder," he told News24 in February.
