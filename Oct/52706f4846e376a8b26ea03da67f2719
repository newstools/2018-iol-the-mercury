Durban - A fundraising campaign has been launched for an ex-Howick High School pupil who was involved in an accident in Hanoi, Vietnam this week. 
Brad Purchase, according to his family, is currently non-responsive and in a coma in ICU. 

"He has a badly broken jaw and some broken ribs. One of the ribs is broken in three places and has caused a lesion on his left lung. He has been surrounded by some of his best friends in Vietnam who have taken him to the best hospital where he is in the best hands he could be in," his relative, Shannon Purchase said. 
She said due to the cost of Purchase's medical procedures, his insurance does not cover the amounts. AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
"His medical bills are already sitting at R150 000. We have exhausted all our medical options and are needing help," she said. 

The family has set up a BackaBuddy account for Purchase, which has raise nearly R80 000 through private donations and the campaign. 
"We have been so hugely overwhelmed by the generosity of people who have had their lives touched by Brad. We are feeling very hopeful that we might be able to raise the full funds for Brad's recovery. We are expecting the total of his bills to come to around R280 000," she said. 
Shannon described Purchase as a "precious and gentle soul".
