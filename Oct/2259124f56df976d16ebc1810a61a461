Johannesburg - Social media was a hive of activity on Sunday following revelations by Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba that a sex video allegedly stolen from his phone has been used to try and blackmail him. 
Gigaba in a series of tweets on Sunday morning, revealed that the video was first used to try and blackmail him when he was appointed finance minister in March 2017.

He then rejected this attempt and reported the matter to the authorities. 
Now it appears the video has surfaced again - and this time it is circulating among politicians. 
Gigaba then apologised to his family for the embarrassment they may suffer as a result of the video which he says was "meant for our eyes only".

Soon after, the minister trended on Twitter, and it didn't take long for users to share their views on Gigaba's revelations and the leaking of the video. 
Some users took a light approach to the matter, noting that it was "not personal but political" while others sympathised with the Gigaba family over the alleged extortion and sharing of the video.

 Adv Barry tweeted so it's all an agenda from the EFF to sabotage the ANC obviously, because everything that Adv Barry tweets is to destroy the image of any political party except for the EFF. It was probably Malema who commanded the video be posted.#MalusiGigaba
