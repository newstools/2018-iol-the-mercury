Durban - The Department of Basic Education is looking to strengthen the quality of learning in rural schools with the employment of assistants.
The department recently unveiled the Rural Education Assistance Project at Carter High School in Pietermaritzburg.

The project, which aims to benefit pupils between Grade 1 to Grade 4, started about two months ago and in KwaZulu-Natal it was launched in the Ilembe and Umzinyathi districts.
It will also be implemented in the Eastern Cape and Limpopo.

About 250 education assistants have been appointed for a period of three years in KZN, while the value of the programme is assessed. The Mercury understands that each assistant will earn about R2000 per month.
The education ministry said the initiative would ease the burden on teachers as the assistants would assist with the co-ordination of homework, and assist pupils to develop better reading, writing and maths skills.

It said various studies pointed to the fact that children in the country’s rural communities are “educationally disadvantaged”.
“Simply put, we have recruited youths with matric to be placed in rural schools. All received basic training that will allow them to perform the tasks they are allocated,” the ministry said.
