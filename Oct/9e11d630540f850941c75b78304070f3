DURBAN - A joint operation between local police and Mozambican police was conducted in the Emanguzi policing precinct this week, resulting in the arrest of four suspects and the recovery of stolen cattle.
The suspects, aged between 18 and 26, allegedly stole the herd of cattle from Mozambique and crossed the border into South Africa into the Mtikini area of Emanguzi.

“They were detained at the Emanguzi police station and will be sent back to Mozambique. They will be charged for contravention of the Immigration Act and stock theft. Stolen livestock was positively identified through brand marks and transported by members of the Stock theft Unit to Babanana for quarantine purposes,” said police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele.
According to website, DefenceWeb, a report prepared for SANDF Chief General Solly Shoke in August, shows soldiers patrolling South Africa’s land borders, under the Operation Corona tasking, also regularly recover cattle as well as stolen vehicles, narcotics and contraband.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
