Local entertainer Zodwa Wabantu bumped into AKA on a flight as both of them were heading to the Gumba Festival in Ulundi, KwaZulu-Natal. The Durban native couldn't resist snapping a selfie with the "Fela in Versace" rapper when they landed at King Shaka International Airport over the weekend, and shared the picture with fans alongside the caption: "He said hey,I follow you on IG,I like how you keep things Real & the attitude😊 Thank you Super Mega (sic)

AKA and Wanbantu ran into each again at the Gumba Festival, where they were both billed to perform, and posed for another picture with  DJ Tira.
