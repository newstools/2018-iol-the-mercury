Durban - Dozens of members of coastal communities, from Hluhluwe to Port Edward, pleaded with the Petroleum Agency SA to stop oil and gas exploration off the KwaZulu-Natal coast.
At a gathering at Austerville Hall in south Durban, agency officials met the public and representatives of community organisations, hosted by the South Durban Community Environmental Alliance (SDCEA).

Communities asked the state entity, which regulates exploration and production activities, to deny Sasol and Italian oil and gas corporation Eni, oil and gas exploration permits along the coast, stating it would have a negative effect on the marine environment, and their living standards.
The companies have collaborated in a project to locate oil and gas reserves under the seabed at depths of between 3.8km and 4.8km.
Desmond D’Sa, of SDCEA, said: “The entire coastline is going to be the sacrificial zone, and coastal communities will face the onslaught of the oil and gas industry.”AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

Wendy Forse, of Mtunzini, said it was confusing that the companies were embarking on such activities that were projected in the next 20 years, when climate change experts called for a switch to renewable energy in the next 12 years. “This oil plan is looking backwards, not to the future,” she said.
Tebogo Motloung, of the petroleum agency said its role was regulatory, but would take into consideration the comments from the communities.
“Government’s energy policy allows for oil and gas exploration. The policy imposes obligations on the applicants to consult, and it gives interested and affected parties room to express those opinions.”

Comments on draft environmental impact assessment closes on November 8.
