Durban - Ayanda Shezi, one of three men accused of gunning down Durban businessman, Kidesh Ramjettan earlier this year, will remain in custody until his next court appearance. 
Shezi made a brief appearance in the Durban Magistrate's Court this morning. The matter was postponed to November 1 for further pre-trial conference. 

Last week, it emerged that Shezi will appear separately from his two co-accused, Menziwa Mdaka and Zakhele Dubazane. Mdaka and Dubazane are being represented by well-known senior advocate, Jimmy Howse. 
The two men were remanded in custody pending their next count appearance on November 22. They are expected to apply for bail by then. 
At the previous appearance, State prosecutor, Surekha Marimuthu, told the media gathered outside the court that Shezi will appear in Monday in a separate court for his pre-trial.

At the time, it was not made clear why the State chose to separate the accused however it is believe Shezi may have already confessed while the other two accused may plead not guilty to Ramjettan's murder.
Ramjettan was gunned down outside his petrol station business in Rossburgh earlier this year.
