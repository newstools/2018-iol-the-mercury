Durban - COSATU says the justice system has failed to protect workers from gruesome abuse by bosses, after revelations that two workers were allegedly burnt to death by their employer.
Moses Magama, 34, and Mxolisi Mkhize, 31, of Luganda, Mariannhill, were allegedly tied up, doused with petrol, and set alight during a dispute with their employer over a missing gearbox.

The two were casual labourers for a tow truck company operating in Mariannhill. The incident happened on October 14. Mkhize was pronounced dead on arrival at hospital while Magama died soon after being admitted.
Sanele Mkhize, Mxolisi’s brother, said the family wanted justice. “We cannot afford a lawyer, but we would like justice to be done. When we heard that my brother and his friend had been burnt, we went to ask him (the accused). He lied and said they were out working. It was only at 7pm that his father arrived to tell us Mxolisi was in hospital. What we saw was gruesome,” Sanele said. “He (the accused) has a lawyer; he is not taking responsibility.” 
Cosatu provincial secretary Edwin Mkhize said they were concerned about the increasing number of cases of gruesome abuse with a lack of consequences for the perpetrators.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

“We are still dealing with a case where an employer set a woman alight,and now there’s this one.
“We feel that justice is failing us. There does not seem to be any intention to impose serious punishment that would send a clear message.”
