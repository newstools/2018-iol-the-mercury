Durban - As government entities camp outside the Treasury, cap in hand, to beg for bailouts, Umgeni Water has bucked the trend, as its financial results for 2017/18 presented yesterday have shown.
Umgeni Water announced yesterday that it had received an unqualified audit and was sitting on a surplus of R1.2billion.

The chairperson of the board, Babsie Mathenjwa, said they were pleased with the performance of the organisation this year. She said the performance showed that although they were a temporary board, they had been a board at “work”.
“I am delighted to say that we will not be seeking any government bailout,” she said.
The report tabled by Umgeni said, for the year under review, revenue totalled R2.9bn, reflecting an increase of R394million - or 16%.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

The organisation has taken over the supply of water to the Uthukela district, which means it is now supplying water to more than 7million people. 
Among its achievements this financial year has been the completion of the upgrading to the Midmar Water treatment works.
Good progress was being made to the construction of the uMshwathi Bulk Water Supply Scheme that will benefit more than 32000 people, including people getting potable water for the first time.
