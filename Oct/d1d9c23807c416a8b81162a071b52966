Durban - Garbage bins overflowed and litter was strewn across suburbs in the city this week after hundreds of workers from the Expanded Public Works Programme, attached to Durban Solid Waste, downed tools. This strike affected both formal and informal businesses in Durban.
 The Mercury took to the streets to find out the extent of the strike in the city.

 Mbalie Shelembe, a Pep Stores employee said she noticed that there are less customers in the shop since the DSW strike.
 “The smell is bad and the dirt blows into the shop. We had to hire someone to clean this morning[yesterday] and we are losing business because there are less customers."


 




 Informal food vendor Thokozani Mavanga, who operates in the Market area said he is losing business because of the foul stench and flies.

 “I sell meat and bread and the smell of the dirt and the flies are chasing my customers away, it is very bad,”he said.
 West street car guard, Xolani Zuma said his customers are unable to park because of the uncollected dirt scattered in the parking bays.

 We discovered Zuma cleaning a parking bay with two small packets on his hands and a bin bag.
 “How you gonna make a living when no one wants to park here. There’s nothing I can do but to clean for myself,“ he said.
