Durban - Beggars have the right to privacy and freedom of movement.

This is the view of University of KwaZulu-Natal law professor Karthy Govender, commenting on a project proposed by the police, to fingerprint and profile beggars in Westville.

Last week, the Westville Community Policing Forum announced on social media that it was launching “Operation Take Back” where beggars would have their fingerprints registered on a database.
Govender said: “For the community policing forum to carry out this operation and curtail the liberty of these beggars, it has to be done within the scope of the law. They have the right not to disclose personal details and they have the right to freedom of movement. If they are taken to have their fingerprints taken, that is unlawful restraint.”

Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbhele confirmed it was a project initiated by the SAPS to prevent crime, but said she could not divulge further information.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
KwaZulu-Natal Department of Transport, Community Safety and Liaison spokesperson, Mluleki Mntungwa, said MEC Mxolisi Kaunda had ordered an investigation into the matter.

Retired Bishop Rubin Phillip, who is co-chair of the Provincial Council on Social Cohesion and Moral Regeneration, said: “Random fingerprinting, photographing and profiling of vulnerable vagrants and beggars is a gross violation of their constitutional and human rights. In fact, these actions smack of old-style apartheid behaviour.”
Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu, the ANC provincial spokesperson, said the operation was patently illegal and the ANC in KZN was “disgusted, humiliated and appalled”.
