Durban - The Verulam man accused of raping his stepdaughter 900 times over a five year period appeared before the Verulam Magistrate's Court via a video link from Westville Prison on Wednesday.

 
  
   
  
  
   The 43-year-old is to re-appear in person next week because of poor video connection. 
  
  
   
  
  
   During the brief court session, the State called for a second interview with 10-year-old rape victim for a further statement.
  
  
   
  
  
   This interview will take place in December, during school holidays.
  
  
   
  
  
   The State said it is still awaiting DNA test results and a psychological report on the child.
  
  
   
  
  
   The rape accused is currently in custody as a prisoner awaiting trial after he was denied bail in July. 
  
  
   
  
  
   The accused was arrested in June. He is alleged to have held his step-daughter captive in their home, used her as a sex slave and made her watch porn. 
  
  
   
  
  
   He faces charges of rape, sexual grooming, sexual assault, exposure of pornography to a child, and grievous bodily harm.
  
  
   
  
  
   The child remains in a place of safety.
