Durban - The  P373 and P280 roads valued at approximately R400 million were handed over to the uMsinga community in the uMzinyathi district by Mxolisi Kaunda, KZN MEC for Transport, Community Safety and Liaison yesterday.
 Kaunda said the roads are providing the surrounding communities with job opportunities to improve their standard of living.

 “We are fulfilling our government’s commitment to improving the lives of the people in rural areas for the better by delivering critical road transport infrastructure,” said Kaunda.
 The P373 which is 22, 2 km long and located under iNkosi Mchunu and is valued at approximately R135, 7 million.
This road offers relief to the community who have experienced challenges connecting to areas of destination for daily socio-economic and educational needs.

The P280 is still under construction with 4km of 16km completed. 
R95, 4 million has already been invested however the completed project will cost R250 million.
These roads will also bring ease of access to motorists using both passenger cars and public transport, who will be able to get to amenities such as eMhlangana Provincial Clinic and schools such as Mabizela, eMhlakothi, eMashunka, eJolwayo and eMangaliso amongst others.  

Kaunda explained that government has set aside R430 million in the R2018/19 financial year for the construction of capital project in the entire uMzinyathi District after a survey found that uMsinga is one of the underdeveloped and impoverished areas in the province.
 He said the Department of Transport has already built an expansive, multi-million Rand network of blacktop and gravel roads throughout the Umzinyathi District in a major development investment that has created a number of direct, local jobs.
 “The department also aims to ensure that the youth, women and military veterans are sub-contracted in all major projects that are awarded by the department,” he said.
