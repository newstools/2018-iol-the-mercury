Durban - Five people were killed and two others seriously injured in a horrific head-on collision on the N2, near Mtunzini, on the KwaZulu-Natal north coast on Sunday afternoon.
The driver of one of the cars burnt to death due to him being entrapped in the car, which ignited upon impact.

IPSS Medical Rescue spokesperson, Paul Herbst, said three more people from the second car were fatally injured and were declared dead by paramedics at the scene.
“An additional three occupants from the same vehicle sustained serious injuries and were trapped in the wreckage. Fire and rescue services used the jaws of life to free the injured from the vehicle whilst the Black Eagle/ IPSS aeromedical service, together with KZN Health Department air ambulance, were dispatched to scene,” Herbst said.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
