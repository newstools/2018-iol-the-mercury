Durban - Duduzane Zumaâ€™s court appearance created an awkward situation when DA supporters who had been picketing against him outside the Randburg Magistrates Court embraced and took pictures with the Gupta-linked businessman.
Duduzane, who was supported in court by his father, former president Jacob Zuma, faces a charge of culpable homicide after he allegedly crashed into a taxi with his Porsche. Phumzile Dube was killed in the crash. The accident happened on Grayston Drive in Johannesburg in 2014. 
Charges were withdrawn four years ago, but they have since been reinstated by the National Prosecuting Authority. 
Duduzane will return to court in January next year. 
When he left the Randburg Magistrates Court, he was seen embracing supporters of the DA who were outside picketing against him, dressed in DA T-shirts. AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
Supporters of the Black First Land First, led by Andile Mngxitama, were also present to support Duduzane. 
Female supporters of the DA who were seen taking pictures and who gushed at Duduzane caused a ripple on social media.
