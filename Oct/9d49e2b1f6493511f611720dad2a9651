Durban - A woman's body, left at a funeral parlour in Ladysmith for the past four years, will finally be buried this week.
The identity of the woman is unknown. 

Her body was taken to the Mchunu Funeral Parlour in April, 2014 by her then-boyfriend, who died just days later. He was buried by his family. 
The body's presence at the funeral home has led to a dispute between the owner of the funeral parlour, Siphiwe Mchunu, and the uThukela District Municipality regarding the process to be followed for her burial. 

The matter came to light after the DA conducted an oversight visit at the parlour earlier this month.
Mchunu said yesterday that the body had been removed from his funeral parlour on Friday by government officials. “Although nothing has been confirmed with me, I understand that the funeral is going to be on Tuesday.”AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

Jabulani Mkhonza, the uThukela District Municipality spokesperson, said the body would be buried as soon as all the legal processes that should be undertaken for a pauper's burial were completed.
DA leader Zwakele Mncwango said it was sad that the deceased’s family would not have the opportunity to say goodbye.

He said the manner in which the provincial government had handled the ordeal had been insensitive and showed its failure to care about the welfare of the poor. 
He added that the DA was glad this issue had been taken up by the law enforcement agencies and that they would be investigating allegations of foul play. “We will monitor this investigation to ensure that all those responsible for this gross oversight are brought to book.”
