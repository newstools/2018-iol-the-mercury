Durban - Final year engineering students from the University of KwaZulu-Natal will showcase their projects at an annual open day event at Howard Campus today.
 Over the past 10 months, final year students in groups of four have worked on 21 projects which cover community awareness, research, design, innovation and purely mechanical projects.

 UKZN dean of Engineering Professor Glen Bright said UKZN offers students a unique opportunity to produce projects in groups.
 “Having a group gives you a better project that's functional. When students go out into industry they will work in groups and it allows them to learn about group dynamics,”he said.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
 Bright said his department is critically aware that their products must impact the community.

 “We want to assist the community where we can,” he said.
 The university is approached by municipalities, The National Research Foundation and Technology Innovation Agency for projects via a recently created incubator division.
 “The incubator division is a pathway where we approach the municipalities, The National Research Foundation and Technology Innovation Agency and they also approach us,” Bright said.

 The dean said some projects have commercial viability especially community projects and are available through the incubator process.
 A Variable Inlet Guide Vane Axial Flow Turbine was designed by Muhammad Sheik, Cherisse Govender, Muhammad Zaid Saib and Lloyd Govender for installation in the Injisuthi River, close to a rural community in order to provide electricity and/or mechanical power for agricultural needs.

 

“The turbine basically alters the angle of the water striking the rotor blades which is variable to cope with different water conditions,” said group leader Muhammad Sheik.
 Senior tutor Johann Gerken said a traditional river system doesn't have enough water pressure to pump through a turbine to generate electricity.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
 “The Injisuthi river doesn't have enough power to power a hydroelectricity station for a small village in the area but this system is designed to take that load head and turn it into electricity to boil water or cook and it only costs about R13,000 to build,” said Gerken.

 Mishkar Bhana, Tristan Chanderdeo, Nhlakanipho Perfect Ndlovu and Ryan Somai have continued the work of last year’s students to complete a Vintage Off-road Rally vehicle which is ready to be made road worthy.

The aim of this project is to explore the conversion of an old, retired 1968 VW Beetle to an off-road all terrain rally vehicle that repurposes old vehicles that are in a ‘scrap’ condition.
 Group leader Mishkar Bhana said his team took the half complete vehicle and put the roll cage on, most of the paneling, the brake system and the fuel tank.
 “The Project is about 98% complete and its really robust in its ability to handle the rally,”he said.

 The Flying Hovercraft, which is not something we see often in South Africa, is also a continued project worked on by Ingrid Botha, Kampamba Chanda, Reece Jhugroo, and  Clinton Naicker.

The purpose of this research and development project was to design a multipurpose hovercraft with the ability to fly over obstacles.
 “Its able to access areas that were not previously accessible like swampy areas where helicopters can't access and boats cant go because of the undergrowth. The Hovercraft should be able to hop over the low lying objects,” said group leader  Ingrid Botha.
Admission to the open day is free, so make you way over to the  Unite School of Engineering building at Howard College Campus, UKZN from 12h00 – 16h00 today to see these exciting projects and more.
