Cape Town - Former Idols SA contestants Anele and Neliswa Mxakaza, who won the hearts of South Africans during the 2013 season of the competition, said the year they spent living in Nigerian pastor Timothy Omotoso's rented Umhlanga home was "the worst experience ever". 

 

 The twins also apologised to the victims of the pastor who is on trial for rape and human trafficking in the Port Elizabeth High Court.

 On Thursday, the sisters said the women who accused Omotoso of raping them are their "blood sisters" and they were made to turn their back on them and support the televangelist when the allegations against him first came to light.

 "We have been in this Ministry for four years and we have lived in his house in Umhlanga for about a year, it was the worst experience ever... we were actually pushed to please the man, we were told that God will punish us if we ever say anything against Omotoso. We lived a life full of threats and fear," the talented pair said.

 

 According to the Mxakaza twins, elders from Omotoso's Jesus Dominion International church "
 played a part in making us run away from our homes to stay in Omotoso’s house". They say that they "were made to believe that Omotoso is the closest person to God and we can never have a relationship with God except through Omotoso."

 

 They went on to say that they were "blinded and our spirits were controlled or locked up somewhere by this man ... we could see all the wrongs but were never bold enough to speak out. Omotoso caused divisions in many families and ruined many people's lives."

 

 This week, Cheryl Zondi gave graphic testimony about her rape ordeal, allegedly at the hands of Omotoso. The twins say that they were aware of similar incidents.

 

 "The rape allegations were not new to us. The girls would talk immediately after it happened in the house. When one (of the girls) was called to the upper room we knew what was going to happen to them. We were made to keep quiet and never say anything. We ran away .. because we knew what was happening. Even when we had left the church we were still not free to talk. We were afraid that something bad will happen to us or our families".

 

 The young women say they are happy to finally be free of Omotoso's influence.

 

 "We are happy to have our lives back and we are ready to excel in life and spread the word and power of God through our music."
