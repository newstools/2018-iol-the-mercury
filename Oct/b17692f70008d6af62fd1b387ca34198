Durban - The Democratic Alliance in KwaZulu-Natal has written a letter to police management in the province requesting a meeting after officials were banned from conducting an oversight visit at the Oribi Village police garage today. 
They have requested that Acting Commissioner, Lieutenant General Lucky Mkhwanazi, meet with them. 

DA KZN Premier candidate, Zwakele Mncwango, said it was their right and duty as MPLs to conduct oversight inspections. 
“According to our constitution, each province is entitled to monitor police conduct; to oversee the effectiveness and efficiency of the police service, including receiving reports on the police service; to promote good relations between the police and the community; to assess the effectiveness of visible policing; and to liaise with the Cabinet member responsible for policing with respect to crime and policing in the province,” Mncwango explained.

He said the oversight inspection to the police garage was set up following claims that there were at least 300 police vehicles booked in a the garage. 
“We wanted to fact find as to why police vehicles were not being repaired or serviced in a timeous manner. We also wanted to inspect the actual infrastructure at the facility, as our 2014 oversight visit revealed some serious issues when it came to infrastructure,” he said. 
Last month, the DA was slated after officials made unannounced visits to three police stations in Durban.
