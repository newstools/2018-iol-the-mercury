Durban - Those wanting to spend the last bit of the school holidays soaking up the sun on the beach, are urged to be cautious as a Spring Tide alert has been issued by the National Sea Rescue Institute as we get ready to welcome in the Full Moon Spring Tide next week.
NSRI spokesperson, Craig Lambinon, said the Spring Tide effect has already started and will continue until the peak of the Full Moon Spring Tide on Tuesday, October 9. The tide is set to last until the weekend.

“We are appealing to parents to make sure that their children have responsible adult supervision around water,” said NSRI spokesperson, Lambinon said.
He said the Full Moon Spring Tide brings a higher than normal high tide, a lower than normal low tide and stronger than normal rip currents.

“Anglers fishing along the coastline, bathers, beach walkers and coastal hikers are urged to be cautious. Rip currents occur constantly at changing locations around the coast daily,” he said. 
He added that the NSRI was concerned as the tide was starting to build in intensity, which will peak on the Tuesday. 

“With this being the last weekend, many people will be wanting to head down to the beach. We are urging those contemplating this to be extremely cautious,” he said. 
Lambinon offered bathers the following tips:



 Make sure you swim where there are lifeguards on duty
 Have the emergency number of the local Sea Rescue unit on your phone
 Do not go into the water to try and help someone in difficulty but rather throw them flotation (like Sea Rescue's Pink Rescue Buoy) and call for help.


“Where and when possible Sea Rescue volunteers will patrol beaches where the lifeguarding season has not yet started,” he said.
