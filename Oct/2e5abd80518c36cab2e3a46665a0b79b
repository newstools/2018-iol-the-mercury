Durban - A 53-year-old man was jailed for life this week for raping his biological granddaughter repeatedly for a period of three years. 
The first rape took place in July 2014.

The then 12-year-old victim was at her grandfather’s homestead at Inyembe Reserve in Port Dunford, when she was approached by her grandfather who raped her while her grandmother was at work.
The accused threatened to kill the victim and her brother if she reported the incident to anyone. 

The grandfather continued to repeatedly rape the victim from 2014 to 2017. 
In 2017 the victim, who was 15 years old, reported the matter to her teacher. 

A case of rape was reported at Esikhaleni SAPS and the docket was transferred to Empangeni Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit for further investigation.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
According to KZN police spokesperson, the grandfather was arrested and was in prison until his conviction and sentence in Esikhaleni Regional Court this week. 

"It is hoped that this harsh sentence will send a clear message to would-be rapists as well as highlight the concern that our children are harmed by those that are closest to them,"
