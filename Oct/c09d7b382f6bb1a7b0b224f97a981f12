Durban - The DA has laid criminal charges against Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, Zweli Mkhize, following reports that he had allegedly siphoned a R2 million ‘donation’ from Vele Investments in 2016 during his tenure as ANC treasurer-general. According to reports, the money was in return for his help in raising funds from municipalities and state institutions.
The DA's Shadow Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Kevin Mileham laid a criminal charge in terms of the Prevention and Combating of Corrupt Activities Act and Section 6 of the Prevention of Organised Crime Act (POCA).

Section 6 of POCA states that “any person who (a) acquires; (b) uses; or (c) has possession of, property and who knows or ought reasonably to have known that it is or forms part of the proceeds of unlawful activities of another person, shall be guilty of an offence.”
“Minister Mkhize is clearly conflicted and this explains why there was little action taken by him to intervene in the several municipalities that lost money to the VBS Heist. The Minister must do the right thing and resign as he has clearly failed to fulfil his duties as Minister and has seemingly breached his oath of office,” Mileham said.
In a statement issued today, the DA said many people nearly lost their life savings and the families of the bank’s retrenched employees have lost a valuable source of income.

“It is now in the hands of the police to investigate these charges to ensure that the Minister is held accountable for any wrongdoing,” said Mileham.
