DURBAN - A Durban man who was allegedly set alight by a police officer is receiving treatment at a local hospital. The family have fingered a local police officer as the main suspect and claim he also burnt the mans house in Inanda, north of Durban.
The victim, Wonder Zwane, 28, was allegedly burnt after being accused of stealing R400 from the girlfriend of the alleged police officer.
Zwane’s family said the woman and the alleged police officer frequented the family as they had their cars fixed there often. 
Speaking to Isolezwe, Zwane’s mother, Gugu, said: “The police officer’s girlfriend said she cannot find her R400 which was in her bag in the house while they were drinking. The police came to ask about the money and then he left. He came back at about 4am and burnt the house and set Wonder alight with petrol,” said the mother. 
The family are reportedly living in fear, while Zwane recovers in hospital. They said they were scared the police officer would attack again. 
The mother said the man had bandages around his face due to the burns. 
The alleged perpetrator confirmed he was a police officer, but denied he was behind the arson attack. 
“I am aware of the rumours that I am responsible for the arson. I was at the house fixing my car, I was surprised when I got to work and people were saying I am a suspect,” he said.
Police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane confirmed police were investigating a case of arson, but did not confirm if the suspect was a police officer.
