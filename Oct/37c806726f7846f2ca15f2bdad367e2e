Durban - Taxpayers wanting to file their personal tax before the month-end deadline are being warned to be vigilant of scams. 
Sars this week issues a statement warning taxpayers to be alert where refunds are promises or where they are informed that they owe monies to Sars. 

“These scams come in various forms including letters, email, website links and even individuals either posing as Sars officials, debt collectors or tax preparers,” Sars warned.
There are instances where tax preparers promise taxpayers a refund in return for a percentage of the refund as a fee. Fraud is often committed in the name of the taxpayer by claiming fraudulent expenses. When Sars does identify this fraud the taxpayer will be liable for the full debt as well as penalties.

Taxpayers should always authenticate communication in relation to Sars via the contact centre or a Sars branch.  Suspicious tax activity can reported online or via the Sars suspicious activity hotline.
 Taxpayers are reminded that tax season is about reconciling tax deductions from the previous year and assessing whether the correct amount of tax was deducted.  This assessment can result in a refund to the taxpayer or a payment to Sars where the taxpayer owes tax to Sars. Alternatively it can result in a nil return, where the taxpayer neither owes Sars nor is due a refund.
