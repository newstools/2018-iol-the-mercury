Durban - "Be blessed, little angel, and know that the nation is behind you, wishing you healing and peace.”

This was one of the heartfelt messages shared on crowdfunding platform, BackaBuddy, in support of the 7-year-old girl who was raped in a toilet at the Dros restaurant in Silverton a few weeks ago. The suspect will be back in the dock next month.

The fundraising campaign is intended to help pay for therapy for the girl. It was started on October 3 by concerned citizens who want to remain anonymous. “We don’t need any recognition - what’s important is that we come together as concerned South Africans to help this young victim whose life has all but been destroyed,” said one of them. 
“Our team was saddened and disturbed by the events, and our hearts go out to the victim and her family.”

The group said: “We know that rape can traumatise the victim emotionally for years afterwards, so we hope the funds raised will be used for therapy and rehabilitation for the victim so that she can have some semblance of normality or even happiness again... we are also happy for the family to use these funds in any way they see fit - we trust the family will know best what to do to help their daughter under the circumstances.”
Since the creation of the campaign, at least 55 good Samaritans have come forward, with one person contributing R31018.97 to bring the total raised to R46879.39. Zane Groenewald, for BackaBuddy, said all funds raised would be strictly managed by the non-profit organisation. He said the money would only be released to the family directly or to the relevant practitioners.
