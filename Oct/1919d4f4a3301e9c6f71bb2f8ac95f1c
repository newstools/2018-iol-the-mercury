Durban - The Democratic Alliance has said they will continue to conduct inspections of police stations and SAPS units across KwaZulu-Natal. This is according to the party’s MPL, Dr Rishigen Viranna. 
He was commenting after the DA was slammed for visiting three Durban police stations in the last week. 

The Mercury reported yesterday that MPL and DA shadow minister of police, Dianne Kohler Barnard led a delegation to the stations where they checked up on each station’s state of readiness to handle abuse, rape and hate crime survivors.
Viranna said they have written to the KZN Community Safety and Liaison office about the condemnation expressed by the province’s acting police commissioner. 
“The instruction, from Lieutenant-General Mkhwanazi goes so far as to say that DA representatives, in particular, are to be denied access to information. It also indicates that parliamentary portfolios committees must first obtain permission from the provincial police headquarters before conducting oversight inspections,” he said.

Viranna added that they will not bow down to the directive. 
“As representatives of the South African public we have a duty to ensure that SAPS is held accountable. That duty requires oversight inspections and station-specific information,” he said. 
Viranna explained that MPLs are entitled to gather information about police conduct, their efficiency and effectiveness. 

“The DA will not let this matter rest. We also request that Lt-Gen Mkhwanazi appear before the committee to answer for this instruction,” he said.
