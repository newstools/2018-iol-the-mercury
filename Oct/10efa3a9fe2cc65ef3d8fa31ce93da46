Durban - Police have declined to comment on whether one of the drivers involved in a fatal crash on the N2 at the weekend, was texting and driving. 
According to the Democratic Alliance’s Rafeek Shah, claims surfaced that one of the drivers was texting at the time. Shah, the party’s spokesperson on transport in KwaZulu-Natal, is calling for an investigation into the claims. 

“If this is proved to be the case then - if nothing else - this terrible incident must serve as a valuable lesson to other drivers,” Shah said. 
Provincial police spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbele, said; “The circumstances around the accident are part of an on-going police investigation.”AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
On Sunday, five people were killed in a head-on collision on the N2 near Mtunzini. 

It is believed that the four people travelling in the one car were related and that they were on their way from Swaziland to Durban.
The driver of one of the cars burnt to death due to him being entrapped in the car, which ignited upon impact.
Three more people from the second car were fatally injured and were declared dead by paramedics at the scene. A fifth person died in hospital.

An additional three occupants from the same vehicle sustained serious injuries and were trapped in the wreckage. Fire and rescue services used the jaws of life to free the injured from the vehicle.
