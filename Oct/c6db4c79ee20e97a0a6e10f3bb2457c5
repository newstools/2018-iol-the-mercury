Durban - The family of slain businessman Kidesh Ramjettan believe there is a mastermind behind the garage owner’s murder, and that more arrests will follow.
Ramjettan’s brother, Anesh Balraj, said police had remained “tight-lipped” about the investigation, but assured the family they would leave no stone unturned. 

The State will hold a pre-trial hearing for one of the three suspects who allegedly murdered Ramjettan in August. 
One of the accused, Ayanda Shezi, did not appear in the Durban Magistrate’s Court yesterday. “We have not received any information and were not told why he hasn’t appeared. We believe there are outstanding arrests because we do believe there is a third party involved,” Balraj said.
State prosecutor Surekha Marimuthu told journalists outside court that Shezi will appear on Monday in a separate court room in preparation for the pre-trial hearing. AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
