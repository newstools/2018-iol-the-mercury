Durban - A KwaZulu-Natal family is hoping that after a four-year long wait, they will finally be able to put their loved one to rest. 
This week, the plight of the family was thrust into the spotlight after the Democratic Alliance (DA) conducted an oversight visit to the Mchunu Funeral Parlour in Ladysmith where a woman’s body has been kept for 2014.

DA leader in KZN, Zwakele Mncwango, is now calling on Premier Willies Mchunu to launch an investigation into why the body has been kept at the parlour for four years. 
Mncwango, during a visit to the parlour, said: “We then followed up with an inspection of the police station and met with the management of uThukela District Municipality to hear their version of what happened. We were shocked to hear that the woman’s cause of death was never investigated".

He said the DA was disappointed that these institutions failed to respect the dignity of the woman. 
“We are calling on the premier to investigate both the departments of Safety and Community Liaison, Cooperative Government and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) for this negligence. He must an end to this shameful event by providing a proper and dignified funeral for the woman and allow her to rest in peace,” Mncwango said.
