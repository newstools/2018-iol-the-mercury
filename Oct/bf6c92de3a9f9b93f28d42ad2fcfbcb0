Durban - A 36-year-old man was handed down three life sentences after he was convicted for raping his daughter several times in 2014. At the time of the attacks, the child was just five-years-old. 
KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, Colonel Thulani Zwane, said the man was sentenced in the Richards Bay Regional Court today. 

Zwane said in 2014, the girl had been left with a childminder at her mother's house in J2 Section. 
"The man went to the mother's house and took the child. He then raped her. The neighbours heard the girl screaming and rushed to investigate. They found the man raping the girl and managed to rescue her. A case of rape was opened at Esikhaleni police and assigned to the Empangeni Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit for investigation," Zwane said. 
He said the father was arrested and detained for the duration of his trial. 

Police investigations revealed that the victim had been raped on three different occasions. The accused was sentenced to three terms of life imprisonment.
