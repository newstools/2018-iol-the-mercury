Durban - A Durban man has been convicted of animal cruelty for attempting to castrate his dog.
In July 2016, Nthuthuko Chaki tried to castrate his dog by placing elastic bands around the dog’s testicles, resulting in deep open wounds.

The Durban and Coast SPCA opened a criminal case against him.
Tanya Fleischer, Durban and Coast SPCA marketing manager, said Chaki did not render any form of veterinary treatment for the wounds and the wounds became infected and swollen.

“The dog was barely able to walk, sit or stand due to the excruciating pain. We estimated that he had been suffering for at least two weeks,” said Fleischer.
The dog had to be euthanised by the SPCA.

Chaki was charged in the Newlands Magistrate’s Court in terms of the Animal Protection Act. He was convicted and sentenced to a R3 000 fine or three months’ imprisonment. AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
“In addition, he has been declared unfit to own or be in charge of any animal for a year from the date of conviction,” Fleischer said.

She added that the organisation was pleased that the sentence was not suspended and that a request for deferment was denied by the presiding officer.
“This was unprecedented for us and we are very proud to have brought this perpetrator to justice,” she said.

Fleischer said the matter had been handled by inspector Lucas Moloi, who had personally appeared 13 times in the past two years since the charge was laid.
“We are immensely proud of our team and of our inspectors who work tirelessly on each and every case, ensuring that justice is served.”

She added that the act committed in the case was an “archaic and cruel practice” which had been commonly used in rural areas in the past.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
“Cases of this nature are rarely reported nowadays but still occur.”
