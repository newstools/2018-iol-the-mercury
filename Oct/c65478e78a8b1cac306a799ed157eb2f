Durban - Nineteen men, believed to be behind a spate of bombings in the greater Durban area, which also claimed the lift of Abbas Essop, are due back in court for their formal bail application. 

 

 This morning, Essop's relatives gathered at the court where they held a placard demonstration calling for the court to oppose bail. 

 

 Essop was killed in a horrific attack at the 
 Imam Hussein Mosque in Verulam in May this year. 

 

 The men are also being charged for the numerous "bomb" threats at the various Woolworths stores in KZN in July. 

 

 They face a raft of charges, including terrorism, murder, attempted murder, extortion, kidnapping, contravention of the Explosives Act and arson. 

 

 Outside court, members of the mosque could be heard chanting in Arabic about the oneness of God. 

 

 "We want justice. These men are not remorseful for what they have done."

 

 Police Minister Bheki Cele made the announcement of their arrests two weeks ago at a press briefing in Durban. 

 

 All the court appearances have been held in-camera. Members of the media are not allowed in the courtroom.
