Durban - The 19 suspects arrested in connection with a spate of explosive devices found at retail stores in Durban are expected to make a bail application next week.
The suspects are also linked to a fatal attack at the Imam Hussein Mosque in Ottawa in May.

The media and public were again barred from court proceedings yesterday. Some of the city's top lawyers are representing the accused however they declined to comment saying they were made to sign non-disclosures. 
Speaking outside the Verulam court, Hawks spokesperson Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi said the ID parades will be conducted in the week. 

He also revealed that the suspects are linked to 11 different cases in the Durban area since around March this year. 
The arrests came after numerous raids at a number of properties in the city last Friday. During the raids, a man believed to be kept as a hostage was found chained in a dungeon-like room at a place of worship. The man is currently in a KZN hospital under heavy security. 

In the meantime the suspects, whose identities have been kept secret, will be held at the Westville Prison.
