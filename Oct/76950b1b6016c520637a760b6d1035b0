Durban - Snake catcher Jason Arnold is waiting for the weather to clear before looking for a huge black mamba in Verulam that residents believe has caused dogs to disappear.
“I’ll go today if it’s not raining,” Arnold told the Independent on Saturday on Thursday morning.

A gardener employed by resident Willy Mayendisa spotted the serpent while chopping down an old, dead tree, Mayendisa said. He took photographs of it, which he gave to Mayendisa.
“We are really scared of it,” said Mayendisa.

“Over the years dogs have gone missing,” he said, suspecting that they had encountered the snake while cooling off at a nearby river where there are many reeds. However, no carcasses had been located, he said.
Mayendisa added that the snake had posed more of a problem when he lived at his previous home in the same street. “But when I move to my new place I built a retaining wall and I think that kept him out,” he said.

Arnold expects the snake to be about two metres long but said it was hard to judge from the photograph because “there’s nothing to scale” it against.
