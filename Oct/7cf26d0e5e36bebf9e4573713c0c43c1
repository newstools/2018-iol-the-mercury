Durban - One of the 19 men accused of terrorism following a series of bombings in Durban was released on bail of R100 000
The accused, Goolam Mahomed Rasheed Haffejee, 38, from Parlock, along with 18 other suspects appeared before Magistrate Irfaan Khalil at Verulam Family Court today.

The men, who police allege are also linked to the attack on the Imam Hussein Mosque in Verulam where Abbas Essop was killed in May, also face charges of murder, attempted murder, extortion, kidnapping, contravention of the Explosives Act and arson. 
According to Khalil, the state is not opposing bail because he was not pointed out during the ID parade and he is not considered a flight risk.

Khalil said as part of Haffejee's bail conditions is that he is not allowed to leave KwaZulu-Natal without written consent from the investigating officer. He is also not to communicate directly or indirectly with witnesses. Haffeejee must hand his passport to the investigating officer and is not to apply for emergency passport or any travel documents. AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
Meanwhile, the state, however, wants to provisionally withdraw charges against seven of the accused.

The media was today allowed to sit in court for proceedings. Previously the hearings were held in-camera.
