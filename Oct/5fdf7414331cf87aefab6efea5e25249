Durban - In a bid to fast-track Radical Economic Transformation (RET), eThekwini Municipality mayor Zandile Gumede invites all legal businesses to register in the ward-based business database. 
This aggressive campaign seeks to ensure that all legal businesses based in wards are registered and are in an advantageous position to have a slice of the big pie. According to Gumede, this should start at ward level to paved way for RET, the city launched last year, to be permanently rooted in former disadvantaged communities. 

“The municipality came up with this initiative to promote inclusive business growth and breed entrepreneurs. The campaign allows all businesses to be treated equally and have a fair chance of being awarded Municipal work. We want to do away with the monopoly of big business. We want to see big projects where our people live eradicating grinding poverty speedily. This is the position we have taken and we are not compromising in this regard,” said Gumede. 
With the ward-based business database campaign in full swing, Gumede is optimistic that the municipality in a short space of time could tower above the rest in implementing RET. 

“We are in a mission to give fair opportunities to black and emerging entrepreneurs, youth, disabled and women. This database will also give an account of how many businesses have participated in certain projects. This will help us to ensure that those who never benefited are prioritised,” Gumede added. 
The current eThekwini Municipality database and the central database does not cater for ward representation,plans are now afoot to ensure that the city’s database is updated to include the ward business representation. 

She urged businesses to take an advantage of this initiative because it will also assist ward enterprises on compliance issues and that they are registered on central supplier database and vendor portal.

•Companies and Intellectual Property Commission (CIPC)

•Valid tax clearance
