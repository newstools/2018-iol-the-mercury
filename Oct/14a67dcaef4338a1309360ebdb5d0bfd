The disciplinary hearing of Gideon Phungula, the suspended head of eThekwini Municipality’s legal and compliance unit, began this week.
Phungula has been on suspension since September after leaked phone recordings allegedly between him and a colleague surfaced. In the recording, racist remarks were made against Indian colleagues, including the city’s treasurer, Krish Kumar.

During the leaked telephone conversation, there was talk of manipulating the disciplinary hearing of Zandile Sithole, the suspended deputy head of supply chain.
Sithole is a senior manager in a department that decides who receives tenders.
Phungulu confirmed the hearings had started and said he was representing himself. He is facing six charges and has pleaded not guilty to all.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

“The hearing is continuing and I can’t say much. I will wait for the outcome. I deny all the charges laid against me,” he said.
The charges include hate speech and racism, but go beyond the leaked telephone conversation.
It includes allegations of dishonesty in relation to his previous employer. Phungulu was employed by the city in June this year.

The hearing continues.
