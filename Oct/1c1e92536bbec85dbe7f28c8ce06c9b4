Durban - Today is the second of the Jobs Summit at the Gallagher Convention Centre in Midrand. 
The Summit convened under the auspices of the National Economic Development and Labour Council (Nedlac) brings together all Nedlac constituencies comprising government, organised labour, organised business and organised community under one roof to focus on collaborative and high-impact interventions to drive job creation, job retention and economic growth.

 President Cyril Ramaphosa stated that the Summit would examine what needs to be done to ensure the economy grows and becomes more productive, that companies invest on a far greater scale that workers are better equipped, and that economic infrastructure is expanded.
