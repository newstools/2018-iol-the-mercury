Durban - Poor weather conditions forced rescue teams to abandon their search for a young boy, who went missing while swimming at Blythedale beach on Monday. 
This morning, IPSS Medical Rescue teamed up with KwaDukuza lifeguards and officers from the SAPS Search and Rescue Unit to search for the 16-year-old Gledhow resident. 

On Monday, the boy is believed to have gotten swept away out to sea. 
IPSS Medical Rescue spokesperson, Paul Herbst, said several vessels were launched, covering the northern and southern sides of the point of entry. 

“Four vessels were launched this morning and beach patrols were also conducted with negative results,” he said.

Herbst said the inclement weather, scheduled for the remainder of the week could put a damper on further search and rescue efforts. 
“We will have issues with the weather when it comes to the launches and the searches in the sea. The land-based searches will continue, either on foot patrol or all terrain vehicles, We can still use the drone but this will depend on the weather conditions. The swells may jeopardise what we see in the water,” he said. 

Herbst said boy’s parents have been present during the patrols. 
“The family may just camp out on the beach until we find the body. Every time we do go down, it’s not nice to come back to the family and we have negative results,” Herbst said.
