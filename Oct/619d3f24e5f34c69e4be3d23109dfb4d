Durban - Kessie Nair, the former councillor who called President Cyril Ramaphosa the k-word in a video posted on social media says if he is kept in prison he may die from his heart condition.

Kessie Nair submitted a lengthy affidavit to the Verulam Magistrate’s Court yesterday in support of his release on bail. 

In his affidavit, he said it was common cause that he is seriously ill and his heart is performing at just 29% capacity. 
Nair told the court that he is on an organ transplant list and needs to be readily available for the trans- plant when a heart becomes available for him.

He said it was likely that his release from prison for the transplant operation would be “fraught with red tape”.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
Nair, who is facing crimen injuria charges, also alleged that the Hawks’ investigating officer Warrant Officer Anuresh Lutchman was “dishonest, insane and malicious”. 

He said the charges against him were “preposterous”.
The matter was adjourned to October 17 for a decision on his bail.
