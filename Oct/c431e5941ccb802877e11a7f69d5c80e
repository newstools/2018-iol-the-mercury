Durban - The Congress of South African Trade Unions are urging motorists to make alternate travel routes as they will be holding a picket at the N3 Mariannhill Toll Plaza from 10am.
Cosatu’s Edwin Mkhize said members will gather at the Curries Fountain Stadium from 8am and thereafter proceed to the toll plaza from 9:30am. 

He said the picket is to publicly condemn the petrol price and VAT increases as well as highlight other matters affecting residents.
“We strongly oppose and condemn government’s VAT and fuel hikes.  These above inflation tax hikes are suffocating workers who are already battling to cope with; an 36% unemployment rate, thousands of workers retrenched across economic sectors, nine million unemployed and rising food, transport, water and electricity inflation,” he said.

Further demands by Cosatu:


 Reduce the fuel levy and other taxes
 Taxing the wealthy to subsidize the poor
 Clean up the corruption
 Wasteful expenditure 
 Looting of the RAF by lawyers
 Invest and expand public transport
 Ensure the safety of public transport (trains, taxis and buses)
 Ensure the reliability of Metro Rail
 Reinstate a dedicated full time rail way police under SAPS
 Deal with criminal syndicates vandalising Metro Rail
 Deal with lawlessness in the taxi industry
 Ensure the taxi industry is properly subsidised and supported by the state
 Invest in producing electric buses, cars and bikes locally to reduce our dependence upon a volatile and expensive oil industry
 Explore the nationalisation of SASOL to provide cheaper petrol for South Africans.



 On VAT, Cosatu demands that government:


 Reverse the VAT hike or announce when it will come to an end
 Implement the recommended additional VAT exempt products by the VAT Panel
 Exempt locally produced poultry from VAT as a key food for the poor
 Exempt sanitary pads and school uniforms from VAT
 Purchase locally produced sanitary pads and school uniforms for the poor and distribute them at government schools, clinics and hospitals
 Introduce a progressive sliding scale for VAT for water and electricity for the poor
 Introduce luxury VAT rates for luxury goods and imports
 Overhaul the tax regime to make it more progressive, 
 Less burdensome to the poor and to ensure the rich pay their fair share
