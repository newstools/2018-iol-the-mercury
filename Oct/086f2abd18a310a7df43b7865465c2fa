Durban - Police are investigating a case of murder after an elderly man was found murdered in his Manor Gardens home earlier today.
The man, in his 70s, was found bound and gagged in his house. It is believed that his body had been lying in the house for two days before it was discovered by workers at his property in Glenturret Road.

Blue Security spokesperson, Andreas Mathios, said workers arrived at the man’s house at around 9am and noticed that he did not come out to open for them, as he did before.
“The men had come to do some construction work at the property. They flagged down one of our technicians who was driving passed the property. He alerted our control centre and an armed response officer was dispatched to the scene,” Mathios said.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
He said an officer went inside the house and found the man’s body in one of the bedrooms.

Mathios said the man was bound, gagged and had wounds on his body. 
“According to paramedics the victim has been dead for about two days,” he said.
He said it could not be determined what, if anything, had been taken during the attack.
