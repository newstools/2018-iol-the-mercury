Durban - Teacher union, Sadtu, has described attempts to freeze teacher posts in the last term as “the highest level of exploitation.”
The department recently issued a circular detailing a freeze on the hiring of substitute of temporary teachers. They were forced to withdraw it following intense opposition by the unions.

The union addressed a media briefing on the subject today.
"Sadtu was informed by its members about this circular and we reject it and its contents with the contempt it deserves. The employer in the same circular had the audacity to tell schools to improvise by rearranging the duty loads of educators who are on leave. This call by the department was actually telling principals that they must subject teachers to the highest level of exploitation,” said Sadtu provincial secretary, Nomarashiya Caluza.

  Provincial secretary of Sadtu Nomarashiya Caluza has harshly criticised the circular issued by the department of education of freezing the appointment of teachers during the last term. The circular has since been withdrawn.
 


Caluza said they had taken notice of the matter and how the department continued to make announcement that affect employees without an input from the unions.

"This is something that we will not stand for," she said. 
She said the last term was a critical period in any school where important work was still being done. She added that preparations for the following year were being seen to. 

"This needs to be done with no mistakes and it is unreasonable to burden teachers with more work loads," she said.
