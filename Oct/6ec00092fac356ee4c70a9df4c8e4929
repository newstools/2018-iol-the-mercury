Palu - The Indonesian government has placed eight conditions for foreign non-profits wanting to assist with the search and rescue mission in Palu.
The conditions were amended on Sunday, on the day the 25 Gift of the Givers volunteers reached the city.

Ahmed Bahm, Gift of the Givers team leader, said the organisation would change focus to doing humanitarian work as they were not allowed to help with search and rescue.
