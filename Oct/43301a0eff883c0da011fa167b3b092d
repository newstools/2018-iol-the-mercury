DURBAN - A spate of high-profile court cases are scheduled to proceed in various Durban courts in November.
The mother of Baby X is due to be sentenced in the Durban High Court on November 1. She was convicted in September for the 2014 murder of the three-year-old. She was convicted for a string of other abuse charges that also involved her two other children. 
The children’s grandmother had also been in the dock with the mother but she died as an awaiting trial prisoner.
On November 8, Gavin Faustman, the last of a trio involved in a child pornography case will appear in the Durban Regional Court ahead of his trial. The two others, Jacques Rheeder and Wayne Parkes, who were tried separately, are already behind bars.
Parkes received two life sentences for child rape and 10 years for having and creating child pornography.  Rheeder was sentenced to five years for having child pornography.
They were caught after the United States Department of Homeland Security picked up that they were visiting flagged sites.
On November 14, the trial of Durban North sex worker Siam Lee’s alleged killer is scheduled to start in the Durban High Court.
Her charred body was found in a sugarcane field near New Hanover in January after she disappeared from a house used as a brothel in Margaret Maytom Avenue, Durban North.
