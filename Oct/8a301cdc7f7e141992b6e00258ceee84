Durban - A fleet of vehicles with advanced equipment was handed over to the Road Traffic Inspectorate (RTI) and Metro Police to deal with offenders on the provinceâ€™s roads during the launch of Transport Month yesterday.
Transport and Community Safety Liaison MEC Mxolisi Kaunda announced that roadblocks and early morning raids of the kind that took place in Point Road yesterday and were conducted jointly by the SAPS, RTI and Metro Police, would be a permanent feature. 

Kaunda noted the 1.2% decline in road fatalities between February and June this year. However, he said he was not happy about the decline and set a target of 5% by the start of the festive season.
He warned all motorists to change their mindset, saying drivers needed to adhere strictly to the rules of the road. 

Pedestrians and passengers should always remain vigilant and exercise their right to speak out for their safety, he said.
He added that the owners of vehicles - both business and private - needed to ensure that their vehicles were properly maintained, serviced and kept in a roadworthy condition.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
