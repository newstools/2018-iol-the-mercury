Durban - STRONG winds blew away more than hats on Tuesday, with trees being sent crushing to the ground around Tuesday afternoon in Durban.
A huge tree on Clarence Road in Morningside fell on the road, blocking the access towards the upper Berea area and Durban Girls College area. It went down dragging an electric cable with it, which appeared to be live.
The Berry and Jones families were on call at the scene, having noticed the fallen tree on their way home from the Maris Stella School where their children attend.
Kenneth Jones said they raced to the scene with his daughter Allegra, along with Lauren Berry and her daughter Cianna. 
“This usually happens more in Glenwood, our trees are too posh to get pulled down by the wind,” the mother joked. 
Kenneth said the strong winds made his car shake and said they brought the children to play on the tree when they saw it in the middle of the road.
