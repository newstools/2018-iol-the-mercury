Durban - Electricians contracted to Msunduzi Municipality have been struggling to make ends meet, with some facing repossession of their assets after the council failed to pay them for four months.
Due to the tough economic times, and increase in fuel and food prices, contractors said they had no choice but to continue working “on faith” that the municipality would make good on their payments to them.

Msunduzi municipality has not responded to The Mercury’s numerous queries. 
According to one of the contractors, money due to them was usually kept in a “revenue protection” account, but insiders have revealed that the account is “virtually empty”.
“We are not sure whether the money has gone to another account or what is going on. The municipality has not communicated with us, so for now we are just working and hope they will pay us soon,” said one contractor. AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

The contractor did not want to be named for fear of vicitmisation.
He said the workload had also increased when the municipality asked them to work over the weekend.
 About 40 contractors from 11 companies are awaiting payment.
