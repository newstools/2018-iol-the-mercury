DURBAN - BABY Ariella Cocorozis - who suffers from a rare brain tumor is set to be released at the Parklands Hospital, the family said in a statement.
Ariella, 5, was diagnosed with the rare brain tumor diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) just a few days after her fifth birthday when she collapsed at her Tree Tops preschool in Musgrave. 
“Ariella completed her external beam radiation therapy today (16 treatments done) and should be going home,” said Anastacia Kougianos, a family spokesperson.
“Ariella has been an amazingly strong little girl throughout the radiation therapy and stolen the hearts of the Parklands Hospital radiation team who threw her a lovely little party on Friday for her. She was most excited to have a cupcake,” she said.
Ariella’s parents, John and Emelia, are set to review feedback from experts and treatment options available overseas for the little girl.
The family said an MRI scan would be conducted in about two weeks at the request of the child’s peadiatric, Dr Monica Vaithilingum.
“Ariella's progress will impact this decision greatly and we hope the results of her next MRI will be excellent news. John and Emelia are keeping Ariella in good spirits and are blessed to have the community supporting them while they attend to Ariella.  
“I saw them today and they both advised how attentive Dr Vaithilingum has been with Ariella. Ariella beautiful smile brings joy to everyone in the room,” said Kougianos.
Meanwhile, a crowdfunding campaign for the little girl on Back-a-Buddy has raised just over R230 000.
