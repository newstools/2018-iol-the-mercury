Durban - The suspects arrested in connection with a string of incendiary devices planted across Durban were arrested on Friday afternoon and are expected to appear in court next week.
The suspects have been linked to the attack on a mosque in Verulam that took place in May.

One worshiper was killed and two others injured when three men entered the mosque and attacked them, before setting the mosque alight.
Several days later, an incendiary device was found beneath the pulpit of the mosque.

Police Minister Bheki Cele, revealed this at an urgent press briefing on Friday afternoon and said that police had just arrested three “main targets” and more arrests were to be made.

“The charges may include murder, contravention of the explosives act, and arson among others,” Cele said.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
Early this year, several explosive devices were found hidden in retail stores, including Woolworths, across Durban.

He declined to provide further information on the identity of the suspects as further arrests were imminent on Friday afternoon.
The suspects are expected to appear in court next week.
