Durban - A cemetery security guard had to be airlifted to hospital after he was found with a single gunshot, hours after he was shot whilst on duty.
Rescue Care’s Garrith Jamieson, said the man was found lying on a bank at the cemetery in a serious condition. He had sustained a single gunshot wound to the upper body. The man worked at a cemetery in Molweni, near Pinetown.

“He was attended to by our advanced life support paramedics before he was carried to an ambulance. Due to the location and the extent of the guard’s injuries, Rescue Care contacted IPSS Black Eagle Aeromedical Helicopter to fly the patient to a specialist facility for the urgent care he required,” he said. 
Jamieson said the man was attacked last night and was shot during the ordeal. 

He said the guard, in his 20s, was found by his colleagues who then called for help. 
Jamieson said police would be investigating the matter further.
