Durban - A male pantropical spotted dolphin was rescued on Sunday morning after he was separated from his pod and got into difficulty between the rocks at uMhlanga’s main beach in front of The Pearls development.
In a joint effort, members of the uMhlanga Rocks Surf Lifesaving Club (URSLC), the National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI), uShaka Marine World and Casea Charters all pitched in to save the distressed dolphin. 

Kit Case, the owner of charter fishing company Casea Charters - whose boat was used to transport the dolphin - said lifesavers from the URSLC were training on the beach and spotted the dolphin between the rocks.
“The lifesavers swam out and grabbed the dolphin and held it on top of the rocks for a while. They realised there was something wrong with it and carried it out of the water and over into grannies’ pool, where it is shallow and easier to hold the mammal,” said Case.

Six lifesavers held the dolphin until Kelly de Klerk, senior animal behaviourist at Sea World, arrived.
De Klerk said the dolphin seemed to have lost his way from a pod of dolphins playing on the backline.

“He knocked the rocks and rolled into the shallows, where he received minor injuries,” said De Klerk.
The dolphin started to go into distress after being held for three hours, explained De Klerk, because of the amount of time taken to make an informed decision to release him.

“Also, these little guys have never been around humans, so once he was stabilised he was starting to stretch and wanted to get back out to sea.” 
Once a decision was made, rescuers placed the 65kg dolphin on a stretcher and lifted it on to the rubber boat to be transported about 1km out to sea.

It took the rescue boat about 15 minutes to a good spot to release the dolphin because of rough sea and strong wind conditions.

Two of the rescuers jumped into the water with the dolphin and, seconds later, after the dolphin had stabilised himself, he “shot off” in the direction of his pod.
“It was a complete team effort and everybody was so ecstatic and so relieved. Definitely one of the highlights of my 20-year career,” said De Klerk.
