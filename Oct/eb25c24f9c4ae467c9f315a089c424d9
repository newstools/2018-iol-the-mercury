Durban - A Bluff street vendor was stabbed in the chest with a bottleneck after she failed to give a cigarette to a man, who did not have money to pay for it. 
Last week, a man approached the vendor in Lighthouse Road and demanded that she give him a cigarette. When the man made not attempts to pay for the cigarette, the woman declined and an argument ensued. 

Blue Security spokesperson, Andrea Mathios, said the man walked off and returned a short while later with a broken bottle neck. 
"He stabbed the street trader in the chest before fleeing the scene. Our armed response officer was called out and he gave chase. The man was nabbed a few metres from the scene," Mathios said.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

He said the woman was treated by staff from the Bluff Medical Centre and was then transported to King Edward Hospital for further care. 
The man was handed over to Brighton Beach police officials. 

In a separate incident, two men were arrested after they were seen jumping into a property in Glenwood. 
“Security guards saw two men jumping into a yard and were able to point them out to our officer. Our officer gave chase and managed to apprehend one of the men but his accomplice got away” Mathios said. 

He said the alleged copper pipe thief was arrested after he removed cables from a residential property in Bottomley Road in Umbilo.
“A tenant spotted the second suspect and provided our officer with a description of the alleged thief. Our officer patrolled the surrounding area and eventually tracked down and arrested the suspect in nearby Bartle Road,” Mathios said.

The men were handed over to police.
