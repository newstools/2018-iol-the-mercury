Cancer is a growing national health and socio-economic concern in the country and the campaign is in line with President Cyril Ramaphosa’s announcement in his State of the Nation address this year that a cancer campaign, similar to the HIV counseling and testing campaign would be launched in the financial year. 
The department said the objectives of the campaign include creating awareness and educating the general public, patients, families and healthcare workers about various types of cancers together with risk factors, prevention methods, treatment services available and support during survivorship. 
The department said the campaign will be implemented in a phased approach. Many cancers are preventable and can be successfully treated through early detection and timeous treatment, which reduces unnecessary suffering and financial strain on patients, family and the health system.
