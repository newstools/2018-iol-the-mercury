Durban - Transport, Community Safety and Liaison MEC Mxolisi Kaunda has called for a thorough investigation, after a fatal collision claimed the lives of seven people on the R74 outside Bergville at the weekend.
Kaunda said a preliminary investigation revealed that a light motor vehicle collided head-on with an oncoming truck while trying to overtake a minibus taxi. The minibus that was being overtaken was also involved in the crash.

ER24 spokesperson Werner Vermaak said that when emergency services arrived on scene just before 8pm on Saturday night, both the driver and passenger of the car had died.
“Both occupants from the vehicle succumbed to their injuries prior to paramedics’ arrival on the scene and four people (women) were found with fatal injuries near the taxi,” said Vermaak.

He said the majority of the occupants from the taxi were flung out during the crash. “Six people sustained serious to critical injuries, five others sustained minor to moderate injuries and one person succumbed to their injuries en route to hospital,” Vermaak said.

The injured were taken to Emmaus hospital and Ladysmith Provincial Hospital to receive medical care.

The minibus taxi was travelling from Durban to QwaQwa when the crash took place, said Kaunda, and Transport Department officials were trying to establish whether the dead are from KZN or the Free State.
Kaunda expressed his condolences to the families of the deceased and wished the injured a speedy recovery. 

The MEC has called for law enforcement to deal harshly with those who disregard the rules of the road. 
“They must pay special attention to reckless and negligent driving, speeding, unroadworthy vehicles, as well as drinking and driving,” said Kaunda. 

KZN police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Zwane said a case of culpable homicide was opened at Bergville police station.
