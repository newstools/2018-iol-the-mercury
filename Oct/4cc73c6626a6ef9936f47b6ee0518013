Durban - For most men, being in the delivery room as their partner gives birth to new life is one of the most memorable moments. 
 

 Dad-in-waiting gets to stand proudly and look on as new life is brought into the world. While some choose to capture the precious moments either in still photographs or on film, it's still one of the most magical moments. 

 

 But for these dads captured in this video montage circulating on Facebook, it may just be right up there as one of their less prouder moments. 

 

 The post on the Pregnancy Pages Facebook page was posted today and has already been seen by more than 150 000 people and shared over 2 800 times. 

 The post has also garnered over 1 000 comments. 

 

 In the four-minute long video, men are seen collapsing, throwing up or completely freaking out at what was going on in front of them. 

 

 One of the fathers is seen collapsing on the floor next to his wife and she is giving birth. While the nurse is concentrating on assisting mom, she has to call for help as dad takes a knock to the head as he falls to the floor. 

 

 Hundreds of women took the opportunity to poke fun at the fathers. 

 

 "We're the ones in so much pain and you guys can't even WATCH without passing out or puking," wrote one of the women. 

 

 Another said tagged her baby daddy and said she was glad that he didn't pass out but instead stayed strong for all three of them.
