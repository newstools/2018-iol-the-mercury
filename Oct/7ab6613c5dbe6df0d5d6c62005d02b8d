Durban - RAMPANT theft of beehives and the massive cutting of gum trees in KwaZulu-Natal’s Midlands and northern Zululand has threatened food production.
Phil Walker, owner of Green Door Apiaries, said although gum trees were regarded as bad aliens that invade indigenous vegetation, they played a crucial role in food production.

Walker, who is also chairperson of the South African Bee African Industry Organisation (Sabio), said gum trees provided nectar and pollen for swarms of commercial bees while bees in return pollinated about half the food crops in the province.
He said about 90% of plants were pollinated by bees, and their extinction from the ecosystem could lead to massive hunger.
“Without them we can probably die of hunger because the food will be scarce,” he said.

When the Sunday Tribune visited his home in Hilton, Walker was busy with the final stages of bee pollination. He said his business was threatened last year when boxes of beehives were stolen, resulting in a R60000 loss. He alleged that another bee farmer in Northern Zululand has suffered a similar theft amounting to R150000.

“Thieves cut through the electric fence just to steal hives. They set up stalls on the N3 freeway to sell honey on the black market. When the bad guys are approached, they claim bees are God’s creation, and they also have a right to harvest them. They see nothing wrong with their action, which destroys our honey production,” Walker said.
He said he wanted police to treat bee theft the same way as stock theft. He said he will raise it in a meeting with government officials because it was crippling the business.
