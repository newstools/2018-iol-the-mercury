Durban - The upgrade and expansion of the M13 and Essex Terrace Interchange and bridge in Westville is set to begin this month.
Westville councillor Warren de Marigny Burne welcomed the project.

“Undoubtedly the amount of traffic going through that intersection is more than it can handle,” he said.
Thami Manyathi, the head of the eThekwini Transport Authority, said traffic on the interchange had increased significantly because of new residential, office and shopping developments. 
“The bridge on the M13 over Lincoln Terrace will be extended on both east- and west-bound carriageways. The on- and off-ramps will also be upgraded, extended and realigned to accommodate current and expected increases in traffic,” said Manyathi.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

According to Manyathi, Devon Terrace, Lincoln Terrace, Latina Place and Essex Terrace will also be realigned and form part of this construction contract.
De Marigny Burne said that, during the construction, traffic will be redirected on to the one lane of the M13 in both directions. 
Manyathi advised commuters using these routes to start their journeys earlier and to consider alternative routes.

“We ask that people be mindful of the construction for their own safety and the safety of those working on the roads,” said Manyathi.
Community members are invited to attend a meeting, where the construction plans will be explained, which will take place at Truro Hall in Westville tonight at 7pm.
Notifications will be posted on the GO!Durban and eThekwini Municipality Twitter and Facebook pages.
