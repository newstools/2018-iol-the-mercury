Durban - Durban University of Technology (DUT) management has warned students to return to classes today, saying further strikes would have consequences.
Students were protesting over food, rental and other allowances that should have been paid by the National Students Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS).

SRC president Sesiyanda Godlimpi said the strike would continue today, saying although the university had met some of the students’ terms, some allowances were yet to be paid.
There were minor clashes between police and students, and one student was arrested and released on R500 bail. 

Alan Khan, senior director of corporate affairs in DUT said the SRC allegedly agreed to consider calling off the strike in order to allow NSFAS interventions to be implemented.
Khan said there was confirmation from NSFAS that payments for 9000 students were to be processed manually for the money to reflect today. 

He said the Finance and IT departments have gone the extra mile to pay the remaining students relief allocations to ensure that, while NSFAS finalise their processes, students are able to continue with their studies. 
“Anyone who continues with the protest will be doing so against the will of the SRC, and there will be consequences,” said Khan.
