Durban - It’s time to pull out your umbrellas Durbanites, as rain has been forecast for the weekend! I know right, last weekend was all blue skies and sunshine and this week - nope. It’s partly cloudy with a chance of rain (not meatballs).
The South African Weather Services said partly cloudy conditions can be expected for most of Friday and Saturday with a 60% chance of rain as well as thunderstorms across the province.

On Saturday, those living in Durban, Margate, Richards Bay, Riverview, Underberg, Newcastle, Ladysmith, Mooi River, Kokstad, Ulundi, Ixopo, Pietermaritzburg and Giants Castle can expect rain for most of the day with cloud cover later in the afternoon. 
The weather is expected to ease up on Sunday with partly cloudy conditions in the morning and 30% chance of showers and thunderstorms set for later in the day.

Don’t forget about the severe weather warning issued yesterday by the Saws.
