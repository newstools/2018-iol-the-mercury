Durban - KZN MEC for Arts, Culture, Sport and Recreation Bongi Sithole-Moloi opened the newly-built Port Shepstone Museum under Ray Nkonyeni Municipality yesterday.
The MEC unveiled the new museum on behalf of Premier Willies Mchunu who was unable to make it to the event.

To ensure the content in the museum reflects the area’s dynamics correctly said the MEC, the department conducted a drive to consult the greater community of Port Shepstone and surrounding areas.
During the process artefacts and cultural items that are being used in displays were collected.
Sithole-Moloi said not many of us knew what they were, let alone what was in them.

“The reason for that was that the museums founded during colonial time and under Apartheid were geared towards the preservation of European culture and were all built in areas where White people lived,” she said.
It was not easy said Sithole-Moloi for Africans to visit these institutions which were built in areas where they were not wanted.
The museum will showcase diverse cultural and historical themes of the people from the area.

The handover coincides with the birth month of Mrs Albertina Sisulu, whose milestones and that of Dr Nelson Mandela are being showcased in one of the displays. 
The display commemorates the contribution of these stalwarts to the history of South Africa. 
Communities surrounding Ray Nkonyeni Municipality will benefit from the museum as it has committed to educating the communities through rich programmes and research to understand their heritage better. 

The Museum has on display the unique geographical features of the area, namely the Oribi Gorge and the Red Desert.
