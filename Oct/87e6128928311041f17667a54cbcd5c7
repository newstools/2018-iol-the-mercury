DURBAN - THE father of the missing Chilean tourist has identified his body at the Ladysmith mortuary.
Sergio Yaksic, the father of the missing man, Slavko ‘Kako’ Yaksic, said he was a “100% certain” it was his son. He said the body was found with his Chilean identity documents, bank cards and driver’s licence.

The father identified the body, which was in a state of decomposition, by the clothes and the man’s hands. He said the body had been at the mortuary since October 13.
Yaksic, 29, went missing in September when he was last seen in Dundee. His father, Sergio, arrived in the country this week to assist in the search, which was being conducted by police and private investigators.
“I’m profoundly sad, but at the same time calm with a feeling that Slavko was a very happy person and, especially these last years, he had an enviable spiritual growth, an emotional maturity that for all of us generates a tranquillity by only seeing him,” said the father.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

He paid homage to his son.
“Slavko is not dead, he is travelling, in a place where he is loved and valued, knowing new cultures, new people, and making people with him happy to be with him.
“My Kakito gave me so much happiness in 29 years. I don’t need to have him by my side for him to be with me,” he said.

He thanked the police, private investigators and everyone who helped in the search for Yaksic.
Private investigator Chad Thomas confirmed the father had identified the body and said they had visited the scene where he was killed.
Police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed a body was found at the Ladysmith mortuary. Police would conduct DNA testing to confirm the identity of the man, she said.
