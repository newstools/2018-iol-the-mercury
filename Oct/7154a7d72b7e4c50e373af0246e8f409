Durban - The state will hold a pre-trial for one of the three suspects who allegedly orchestrated the death of Durban businessman, Kidesh Ramjettan. 
Accused, Ayanda Shezi, did not appear alongside his co-accused in the Durban Magistrate's Court today. 

State prosecutor, Surekha Marimuthu, told the media gathered outside the court that Shezi will appear in Monday in a separate court for his pre-trial. 
It was not made clear why the State chose to separate the accused however it is believe Shezi may have already confessed while the other two accused may plead not guilty to Ramjettan's murder.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

 


Shezi's co-accused, Menziwa Mdaka and Zakhele Dubazane are being represented by well-known senior advocate, Jimmy Howse.
Mdaka and Dubazane were remanded in custody pending their next count appearance on November 22. They are expected to apply for bail by then. 

Ramjettan was gunned down at his place of business in Rossburgh earlier this year. Shezi, Mdaka and Dubazane were arrested in Gauteng earlier this month.
