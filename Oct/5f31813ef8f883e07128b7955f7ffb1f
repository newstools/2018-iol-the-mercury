Durban - The Umgeni Water is adopting a much more conciliatory attitude when dealing with “business forums” demanding business from them.
The organisation said during a business breakfast with the media today, that 10 of its sites had been stormed by “business forums”, and military veterans associations demanding that 30% of the work be given to them.

“There was an incident recently where the group who described themselves as military veterans associations stormed our head offices in Pietermaritzburg, they closed the gates and stopped workers from working. We brought them into our boardroom and had a discussion with them and within and hour, they understood how they needed to operate - if they wanted to work with Umgeni,” said Umgeni CEO, Thamsanqa Hlongwa.
Chairperson of board, Gabsie Mathenjwa, said once they started engaging with the  business forums, instead of being confrontational, they found common ground and the forums showed willingness to listen.
“Some in the group are not compliant in governance and lack information about business. We had to teach them what they needed to do to be compliant and even then they are still not entitled to work and they will have to compete for such,” said the Mathenjwa.
