Durban - The Democratic Alliance believes that the recent figures released in the Victims of Crime Survey show that communities are losing trust in the police. 
The party’s John Steenhuisen was responding to the numbers which were released this week by Statistics South Africa. 

Steenhuisen, the DA’s spokesperson on crime, said the stats show that South Africans were afraid to live their lives to the fullest because they lived in fear of crime.

Steenhuisen said at least one in three South Africans are prevented from enjoying open spaces due to a fear of falling victim to a crime. 
“This fear also prevents 17% of respondents from allowing their children to play outside, 14% of respondents from walking to town or the shops, and 11% of respondents from dressing how they want,” Steenhuisen said. 

In a statement issued earlier today, the DA said South Africans clearly also seem to have “complete and utter lack of faith in the SAPS’ ability to be there for them in an emergency”.
The statement read; “Only a quarter of respondents now believe that the police will respond to an emergency in less than 30 minutes, while more than 1 in 10 report they don’t believe the police will arrive at all.

According to Steenhuisen, communities deserve to live in neighbourhoods that are safe, and to trust in a responsive, well-trained, honest police service. 
“The right to freedom and security of the person, as well as to human dignity, is enshrined in our Constitution,” he said.
