Durban - The family of slain businessman Kidesh Ramjettan said the arrests of three men has brought some closure but they want to know who ordered the hit.
Ramjettan was shot dead in the courtyard of his Umbilo, Durban, petrol station, Glazer Motors, in August. In a desperate attempt to find the killer, his family recently increased the reward offered to R300 000. 

Appearing in the Durban Magistrate’s Court yesterday in connection with his murder were Ayanda Shezi, 34, Meziwa Mdakane, 24, and Zakhele Dubazane, 32. 
They were arrested in Dobsonvillle near Soweto, Gauteng, on Tuesday. 
Mdakane and Dubazane told magistrate Mahomed Motala they would get advocate Jimmy Howse to represent them. Shezi asked for legal aid.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

Mdakane also told the court they were being assaulted in the police station holding cells and “forced” to admit to the murder. He added that neither he nor Dubazane were allowed to call family or legal representatives.
Mdakane requested they be held at Westville Prison. However, Motala said the investigating officer in the case needed them at the police station.
“If you are sent to Westville Prison, it may cause delays in the matter. You can make the request via your attorney,” the magistrate said.

Motala ordered the State to arrange for the mens’ legal representative to contact them. 
Family spokesperson Ray Bechoo said the case only started to progress after the reward was increased.
“We are not sure if it was the reward that brought someone forward with information, but we are very grateful to the investigating officer, who never let this case die.” 

Bechoo said the family now hoped they would find out why Ramjettan was killed. 
Ramjettan’s brothers, Anesh and Omesh, attended court proceedings yesterday. However, they were reluctant to speak to the media.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
