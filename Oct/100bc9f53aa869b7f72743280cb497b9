Durban - Thabani Mzolo, the man accused of gunning down his ex-girlfriend, Zolile Khumalo earlier this year, will be appointed a Legal Aid attorney as his now former attorney, Charl Claassen, has withdrawn himself from the case. 
This was heard in the Durban High Court today, where Mzolo’s trial was due to start. The matter, which has been set down for October 8 - 12, had to be postponed to next week. 

Today, inside a packed courtroom, Judge Graham Lopes was informed that Claassen had withdrawn from the case due to financial constraints. He would be replaced by a lawyer from Legal Aid. 
Lopes expressed concerned that Mzolo’s lawyers had withdrawn on the day the trial was expected to to be heard.

“The lawyers cannot announce they are withdrawing in the last hour because of financial consideration, those are issues that should have been sorted out long before,” he said.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
He however accepted that legal aid would be taking over the case so there would be no prejudice.

Mzolo is accused of fatally shooting his ex-girlfriend Zolile Khumalo at a student residence after he apparently failed to accept that she rejected him. It has been reported that he seemingly confessed on Facebook to killing Khumalo.
