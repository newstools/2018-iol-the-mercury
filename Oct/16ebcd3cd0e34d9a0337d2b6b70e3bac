Durban - The South African Revenue Services has assured taxpayers that their eFiling system is stable and performing well. SARS has said that already 3.3 million tax returns have been filed with 50.4% of these via eFiling.
The organisation said the testimony by its executives at the Commission of Inquiry into Tax Administration and Governance by SARS, has led to widespread reporting in the media that the eFiling system is on the verge of collapse.

 "The perception created that the eFiling system is on the verge of collapse is incorrect, and unfortunately has the effect of creating unnecessary alarm and uncertainty," the entity said.
 The eFiling system continues to be SARS’ premier preferred filing channel and has been capacitated to process high transaction volumes. AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
SARS would like to encourage taxpayers to continue using the eFiling channel and submit returns before the October 31, 2018 deadline.    SARS has extended its operating hours to Saturday mornings to assist taxpayers to file personal income tax returns.  The taxpayer also has the option of using Help-You-eFile – an online functionality on the taxpayer’s eFiling profile - which connects taxpayers to a SARS tax agent who can co-browse and assist with the completion of the ITR12 (tax return) form electronically.    All branches will also be open on Saturday mornings with self-help kiosks available for eFiling.
