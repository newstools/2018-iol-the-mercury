Durban - October 10, 2018 and if you look outside your window you will see blue skies and sunshine. A stark contrast to this very day last year when the city was hit by a violent storm that claimed the lives of at least eight people and left hundreds displaced. 
On October 10, 2017 just after 9am what started off as an overcast day quickly changed. On social media, people living in areas south of Durban took to Facebook to ask what was going on with the weather. Within minutes, dark clouds began to gather and the threat of rain was imminent. 

By 9:30am, heavy rains had begun to fall across the city. Some of the worst affected areas include the Bluff, Jacobs, Montclair, Glenwood, Umlazi, Merebank and Isipingo.  The massive storm registered the highest daily rainfall figures for South Durban in recent years.
