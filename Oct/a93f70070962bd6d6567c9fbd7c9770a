Durban - The instability at Msunduzi Municipality looks set to continue as plans are afoot to oust acting municipal manager Neli Ngcobo.
Ngcobo, a senior member of the executive, was appointed via a council resolution to act as the municipal manager following the suspension of Sizwe Hadebe. The ANC caucus is allegedly unhappy with her and plans to oust her before the end of her acting term next month. Ngcobo said she was aware that there were plans to remove her from the acting position.

“I’m not sure what the issue is, but I know that I’m unpopular with some council members. My acting term is to expire at the end of November. I was appointed by a full council, so I’m not certain as to what their (ANC) motion would be,” she said.
Opposition parties said it would be foolish to remove Ngcobo. They said Ngcobo should be hailed as a hero for saving the municipality a billion rand by objecting to investing council money with the collapsed VBS Bank.

Although Ngcobo would not say who had approached the council to invest with VBS, she said: “I stood my ground against investing.”AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
She said between R500million and R1billion of council money would have been placed with VBS. 

DA councillor Sibongiseni Majola said he was against the attempt to remove Ngcobo. 
Attempts to get comment from the ANC in the council were unsuccessful.
