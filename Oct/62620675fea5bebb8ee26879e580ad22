Durban - A new crime fighting tool is helping police track down wanted criminals in Durban North. The Automatic Number Plate Recognition cameras have already cracked more than 30 cases and led to the arrests of wanted criminals and recoveries of hijacked vehicles. 
This week, a man who allegedly robbed a man of R4000, was spotted in Durban View Road and nabbed. 

Marshall Security’s Kyle van Reenen said the car that the man was driving was picked up on the cameras and police were notified of his location. 
He said the driver was positively identified from the Howick robbery and promptly arrested. 
Marshall Security managing director, Tyron Powell, said ANPR is linked to software with a database where all registrations that pass the camera are recorded and checked against a hotlist of wanted or suspicious vehicles on Marshall and police databases. 

When the plate is spotted Marshall security guards and police are notified. 
“They were installed since January 2017 and we are installing three new cameras each month,” he said.
Apart from this week’s arrest, Powell said via the camera and its accompanying technology, they have had 31 success in the Durban North and uMhlanga areas. 

“ANPR is effective in the fight against crime and their successes speak for themselves,” he said.
In July, an Audi SUV which was stolen in Gauteng was recovered. In May, two people were arrested for robbery. The pair would allegedly drive alongside pedestrians in Durban North and rob them of their personal valuables. In the same month, a car that was stolen in Mayville was recovered after a high speed chase in uMhlanga. 
The cameras have been installed in most areas north of Durban. Cameras have also been erected in Pinetown and Westville.
