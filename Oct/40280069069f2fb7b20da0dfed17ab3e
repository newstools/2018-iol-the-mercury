Durban - Police Minister Bheki Cele said three people have been arrested in connection with incendiary devices which were placed in and around Durban including retail stores.  
At a press briefing in Durban on Friday, Cele said a joint multidisciplinary intensive investigation led to the arrest. 

In July bombs were found at the Woolworths stores in Gateway and Pavilion. People had to be evacuated. The store has since begun searching its customers.

Cele said the "three targets" have been arrested for placing and detonating of these devices, as well other crimes. 

"Between March and August in Durban and surrounding areas were plagued with several incidents of placing and detonating of these devices," said Cele. 
"In a separate incident that was linked to the placing of these devices three men were attacked in May this year at the mosque in Verulam that left one person dead and 2 others critically injured," said Cele.
