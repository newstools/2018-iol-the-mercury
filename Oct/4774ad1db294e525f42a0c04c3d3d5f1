Durban - KwaZulu-Natal Premier, Willies Mchunu, will on Tuesday officiate the handing over the Port Shepstone Maritime Museum to the Ray Nkonyeni Municipality community. The event will be a joint collaboration between the Premier’s office and KZN MEC for Arts, Culture, Sports and Recreation, Bongiwe Sithole-Moloi.
This institution houses an exhibition reflecting the history of the local community and surrounding areas.

An investment of R19 160 538. 77 has ensured that the museum has the main exhibition area, three well-equipped collection storerooms, boardroom, three offices, multimedia room, reception area, gallery space, mini outdoor theatre, ablution facilities and parking space.
The handover coincides with the birth month of Albertina Sisulu, whose milestones and that of Dr Nelson Mandela will also be showcased in one of the displays. The display commemorates the contribution of these stalwarts to the history of South Africa. Communities surrounding Ray Nkonyeni municipality will benefit from this museum as it is committed to educating the communities to understand their heritage better through rich programmes and research. To ensure that the content in the museum reflects the area’s dynamics correctly, the department conducted a huge drive to consult the greater community of Port Shepstone and surrounding areas. During the process artefacts and cultural items that are being used in displays were collected.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
