Durban - In a desperate attempt to find the man who killed petrol station owner Kidesh Ramjettan, the businessman’s family has increased the reward for information to R300 000.
Ramjettan was shot at Glazer Motors in Rossburgh, at about 4pm on August 22. He died at the scene while the killer fled on foot. 

The murder was committed execution style, with a shot to the back of Ramjettan’s head while he spoke to one of his customers in the garage courtyard.
According to Ramjettan’s cousin, Niresh Singh, the killer fired two more shots at his lifeless body before fleeing along South Coast Road.

He was a respected businessman and a dedicated and loving family man to his wife, Lonica, and their 2-year-old son, Kiaan. We initially offered R50 000 as a reward for information, but since there have been no leads and the case is stagnant, we thought a higher reward may motivate people to come forward,” he said.
Singh said Ramjettan’s ageing and ailing mother’s last wish was to know why her son was killed. 

“The family have been victims of crime before, however this tragedy is too much to bear. His parents are distraught and (their health is) deteriorating,” he said.
