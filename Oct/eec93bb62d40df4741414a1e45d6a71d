Durban -  Police have arrested a man in connection with an arson attack at an uMlazi train station. Two weeks ago thousands of commuters were left stranded after two trains were torched.
The KwaZulu-Natal MEC for Transport, Community Safety and Liaison, Mxolisi Kaunda said train delays saw members of the community vandalising Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) property including a ticket office, four cars and four train couches.

“Fearing for the safety of passengers and its workers, PRASA suspended trains in the province for a week,” said Kaunda.
The provincial government intervened and held a series of meetings with PRASA, law enforcement agencies and commuters to devise a safety plan in order for train operations to resume.

Kaunda said the arrest will send a clear message throughout the country that government will not tolerate lawlessness which result in the damage of state property.  
“We always appeal to members of the community that if they want to raise their concerns, they must do so within the prescripts of the law instead of resorting to violent protests,” said Kaunda.  

The MEC urged members of the community, particularly rail commuters to join hands with government and expose criminal elements who are hell bent on destroying trains which transport thousands of people, the majority of whom are a working class.
Plans are at an advanced stage to reinstate train operations in Stanger after they were suspended due to safety of the rail network.

The accused is expected to appear in uMlaza Magistrate Court today.
