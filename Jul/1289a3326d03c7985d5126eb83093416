Durban - Colenso community members want their ward councillor to be removed as they allege she has failed in her duties.
The community has held  protests for almost two days and had closed roads, including the R103 route that connects Colenso to the N3 highway, Estcourt, Ladysmith and Bergville.

The protest comes after water and electricity supply to parts of the small town were allegedly “cut off”. 

The target of their anger is Thulile Hadebe, their ANC ward councillor and deputy mayor of the Alfred Duma Municipality (formerly Emnambithi-Ladysmith Local Municipality).

Hadebe declined to speak to The Mercury yesterday and directed all questions to the municipal spokesperson, Siyabonga Maphalala, who said he could not speak about the protest as he was on leave. The Mercury understands that last Wednesday the municipality disconnected the electricity in the area and the community was not happy about this.

“The municipality cut the electricity and then the water. For about a week we had no services and the community blamed the councillor, saying she has failed us,” said a community member, who declined to be named.

The protest started on Sunday night and continued on Monday. 

Mayor Vincent Madlala said they planned to meet the community to find out what their grievances were.  

“As far as we are concerned there are many service delivery projects in the pipeline for that area,” he said.

SAPS spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed that community members had blockaded the R103 and R74 roads, with burning tyres and rubble, on Sunday night. 

“The road was cleared and they dispersed. Again this morning, at 5.30am, they gathered and blockaded the road, throwing rubbish on the street. 

“They also marched towards Inkanyezi township and objects were being hurled during the protest. A case of public violence was opened for investigation. 

“A total of 29 suspects were arrested on Monday for public violence,” she said.
