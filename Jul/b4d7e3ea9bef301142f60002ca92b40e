Durban - Minister of Environmental Affairs, Dr Edna Molewa, has condemned the murder of a park ranger, allegedly at the hands of suspected rhino poachers. 
Last week, reports emerged that a Kruger National Park ranger was shot when alleged poachers opened fire on the vehicle that the ranger was in. 
It is believed that rangers were tracking the movements of poachers in the park.
Molewa sent her condolences to the man's family. 
"My condolences go out to our departed ranger’s colleagues, his family and friends.  His death at the hands of alleged rhino poachers is an indication of the severity of the threat our rangers are faced with a daily basis,” she said. AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
"As we approach the commemoration of World Ranger Day on July 31, I would like to pay a special tribute to our departed ranger for dedicating his life to the protection of the rhino and all other species in the Kruger National Park. It is only through the efforts of our brave men and women on the frontline, that our many species such as the elephant, rhino and lion are conserved in the wild," Molewa said. 
The ranger, whose name is being withheld until the family have met, was from the Bushbuckridge area of Mpumalanga, and was stationed at Crocodile Bridge.
