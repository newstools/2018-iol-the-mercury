Durban - Police have made a breakthrough in their investigation into a mass killing in KwaZulu-Natal at the weekend. The 35-year-old Sydenham resident has already appeared in court. Currently, he faces charges of being in possession of 73 rounds of AK47 ammunition. 
 

 Police did not want to divulge further details, as the matter is still at a sensitive stage. 
 
  
  
   On Saturday night, 17 people travelling in a taxi on the R74 between Colenso and Weenen, came under fire. They were returning from a funeral in KZN and were on their way back to Johannesburg. The 
   eleven were associated to the Ivory-Park Taxi Association in Gauteng.
  
  
   
  
  
   A specialised unit was set up to investigate the attack. The unit was made up of officers from
    The Directorate for Priority Crimes Investigation (Hawks), detectives and the special task force, to trace and apprehend those responsible for these killings.
  
 
 
  
 
 
  KwaZulu-NatalMEC for transport, community safety and liaison, Mxolisi Kaunda, has said that taxi violence and the rise of hitmen operating within the sector was directly related to the “over saturation” of taxis in the market place and no new routes to absorb them.
 
 
  
 
 
  The area where the shooting occurred has been embroiled in its own taxi turf war between rival associations.
