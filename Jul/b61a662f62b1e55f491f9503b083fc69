A large crowd of people were filing in at the Rustenburg Civic to participate on the last leg of public hearing on a possible review of section 25 of the Constitution to allow for land expropriation without compensation.
A delegation of the Joint Constitutional Review Committee are set to wrap up the North West leg of the public hearings in Rustenburg on Thursday.
The committee was instructed by the National Assembly and National Council of Provinces to ascertain whether a review of Section 25 of the Constitution and other clauses are necessary, to make it possible for the state to expropriate land in the public interest without compensation, and propose the necessary constitutional amendments where necessary.
Public hearings were held in Taung on Tuesday, and in the provincial capital Mahikeng on Wednesday.
