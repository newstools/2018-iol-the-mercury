The year's Vodacom Durban July had more fashion misses than hits and two of Mzansi's favourite shock jocks Zodwa Wabantu and Skolopad both had a "who wore it" a better moment at the Greyville Racecourse on Saturday.

Wabantu confirmed beforehand that she would be performing at two marques, while Skolopad admitted that she was doing the Durban July on a budget. 

What had the Twitter streets talking was that both entertainers outfits were very similar to two big international style icons.
