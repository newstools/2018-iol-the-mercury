DURBAN - AS a teen, Nokuthula Zwane would braid people’s hair in her home town, uMlazi, south of Durban. In her early 20s she was a neatly dressed, well manicured and attractive cabin crew member on international flights around the world, until disaster struck: retrenchment. She returned home to open a salon and is now making her mark in the natural hair products field with her products which encourage women to rock their bouncy Afros and natural hair.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by TeadsIt all started when a friend took issue with her own receding hairline. Zwane saved the day, mixed some hair oils together and surprised the friend, who was shocked to see her problem solved. “The word got around and I started getting more orders. This gave birth to our best-seller, the hair oil,” says the 28-year-old. That was three years ago, and soon afterwards the company was born. Initially, she was mixing products in her kitchen and selling orders, but the volume of the orders increased and she had to get out of the kitchen. But Zwane traces her entrepreneurial spirit back to her school days.“My entrepreneurial journey started in high school, when I used to sell sweets and braid people’s hair over the weekends,” she says. She was the youngest of two siblings and her parents struggled to send her to university after she matriculated from Wentworth High School in 2007. So instead, she took a short course and became a flight attendant, a field she described as “glamorous” and “attractive”.“My experience in that field, among other things, involved presentation, the meticulous appearance of individuals and delivering the best customer service,” said Zwane.Zwane started her business with the hair oil product and followed it up with the Ghana-sourced shea butter, shampoo and detangling conditioner. Above: Some of the products that her enterprise Purpul Hair offers, including hair oil, shea butter and aloe vera products. “With my products, I have tried to make them as natural as possible, using ingredients like castor oil, which has growth properties for hair, and aloe vera, which has a hydrating effect,” she says.She retrenched in 2010, which led to her moving to Durban from Joburg, and opening a salon. She was soon rehired in the aviation industry before she called it quits, after about two years, to focus on her newborn baby and business. “During that time, I started experimenting with hair products,” she said. “The journey has been rewarding. I’ve learned a lot about business administration, marketing, human performance and customer service.”Zwane said formalising the business was easy enough but sustaining it proved difficult at times. “I had a lot of constraints with suppliers not delivering or selling me equipment that wasn’t serviceable. Marketing the business was challenging, as I had no marketing background, and it was trial and error in the beginning,” she says.But three years since she formed Purpul Hair, the business has grown steadily.“As a result of the growth in the last three years, we have opened a store in Midrand to meet the demand from our clients,” she says.Zwane employs one staffer full-time and two part-time, and hopes that by the end of the second quarter of next year she will be employing up to 10 people. She said going into business made her “fearless and hard-working” and she now wanted to tap into the billions in the hair industry. “South Africa’s hair industry accounts for 11.6% of the R25.3 billion cosmetics and personal care sector,” says Zwane. “Purpul would like to own 0.2% (about R500m) of that market space. I also want to take the brand into the West African market, as Nigeriais the most populous country on the continent and the largest consumer of beauty products,” she says.Zwane takes pride in her products, having been supported by TV stars including Nomzamo Mbatha and Linda Mtoba. Asked how this came about, she says it’s part of her social media marketing strategy and reflects her confidence in her products. Endorsement“I was able to share samples of my products which received fantastic feedback and endorsements, as in the case of Mbatha. “Her endorsement was fantastic because she is a celebrity with a huge social media following, but there is also recognition in the broader community of university students, medical doctors, financial services and other professionals,” she says.Nokuthula Zwane in relaxed mode.Zwane says black women are becoming more aware of the harsh effects relaxers have on their hair and embracing their natural hair and Afros.“The wave flows from the education of customers who have better access to information. They are more aware of what they do to their bodies, of harsh chemicals such as relaxers, which medical bodies are beginning to study. We black women all have a burned hair relaxer story – imagine the effect on our scalps,” she says.Although Zwane is Joburg-based, she says the response from KZN clients has been massive since the launch of an e-commerce website. “This allowed us to automate certain processes and deliver more effectively to customers. Our order-to-fulfilment has been greatly enhanced as customers have started using their electronic devices. Even before we had the website, we had great support from KZN. The first business fair we attended was at the Durban International Convention Centre.”Zwane envisages the distribution of her Purpul Hair products to all major retailers and sees Purpul as a youth employment vehicle of the future. The products are suitable for all races and children over 4 years old.www.purpulhair.co.za or @Purpulhair Facebook, Twitter and InstagramTIPS* Believe in yourself and your business.
