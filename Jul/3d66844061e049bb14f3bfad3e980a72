Once she crosses the $1 billion mark, she will unseat Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg as the youngest-ever self-made billionaire.  The cover was first shared on the Forbes Instagram account with this caption: 'Kylie Jenner is on track to become the youngest self-made billionaire ever, ahead of even Mark Zuckerberg, who became a billionaire at age 23.'It was added: 'Find out how she built a $900 million fortune in less than 3 years. #SelfMadeWomen.' Kylie recently talked about launching the business in a beauty video for Vogue last month. In the video, she says she had been thinking of starting her own cosmetics company for awhile.  She says her mother was cautious about the ordeal, saying she would have to put up her own money to fund the venture. Source: @kyliejenner/Instagram'I had Kylie Lip Kit trademarked like two years before it even launched and I was like bugging my mom about it. I see it, like, I need to do this. 'She was like "Okay, put up your own money, like stop talking about the Lip Kit." And then I didn't even order a lot and I was like "Okay, if this doesn't work out you're gonna have, like, a lot of Lip Kits in your garage,"' she recalled.Kylie decided to take the risk, and it paid off immediately. 'I didn't even make it to my launch party. I like refreshed the page and in two seconds everything was gone and like I just remember me and all my glam people, my friends, we were like screaming. 'And then the Kylie Instagram used to be Kylie Lip Kit and then the day after I changed it to Kylie Cosmetics and I was like "This is like gonna be something, like, I can actually do, yeah,' Kylie said. Source: @kyliejenner/InstagramKylie's sister Kim Kardashian, 37, has also appeared on the cover of Forbes. She was the July 26, 2016 cover girl and was celebrated for making $45million from one mobile game.

Jenner signed with Kylie Cosmetics’ current parent company, Seed Beauty, in 2014.  The Kylie Lip Kits debuted in 2015 and sold out within seconds.It is generally believed that the Lip Kits sold so well because Kylie changed her looks so drastically with the help of lining her lips on the outside and adding heavy lipstick; she later admitted to getting lip fillers.Earlier this week she revealed she had taken her lip fillers out.  Kylie Cosmetics has done collaborations with Kim, Khloe, Kourtney and even mom Kris. Her sister Kendall, who is a Vogue model, has yet to work with Kylie. The timing is perfect for Kylie to appear on the cover of Forbes as on Friday she is launching her new summer collection. -DAILY MAIL
