Durban - A gang of robbers cut the throat of a resident’s dog during a home invasion in Kloof on Friday morning.
Blue Security community and media liaison officer Andreas Mathios said an armed response officer responded to the scene of the home invasion after a neighbour alerted him to the incident in Peace Road at around 5.50am.
“Four armed robbers, one of them a woman, had entered the property and cut the throat of the resident’s bull terrier with a sharp object, possibly one of the spikes from the driveway gate. They had derailed the driveway gate to gain entry before tying up the resident. They fled the scene with televisions, jewellery, a cellphone, a handbag and other valuables which they loaded into the resident’s vehicle,” Mathios said.
“The neighbour heard the victim’s screams and contacted us for assistance. When our officer arrived at the scene he went inside to investigate and heard the resident screaming for help. He saw her through a window tied up, sitting on the floor inside a bedroom. He noticed two doors were open and ran into the bedroom and untied her, noticing that there was blood on the floor,” Mathios said.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

“The resident told the officer that the suspects had stabbed the dog and asked him to check on it. He found the dog lying near a couch in the diningroom,” Mathios said.
“The dog’s medical condition is unclear at this stage as it will be taken to the vet for treatment this morning. No other injuries were reported,” Mathios said.
Kloof SAPS attended the scene of the crime.
