Durban - Police arrested three people for stock theft after the hacked up carcass of a cow was discovered in the back of their Mazda 323 at Glebelands on Thursday.
Captain Nqobile Gwala said police were patrolling at the hostel yesterday at 5.30am when they noticed a white Mazda 323 with three suspicious looking men. "The vehicle was driving past Glebelands, along Prince Mcwayizeni Road, at a slow pace. The vehicle looked as if it was carrying an unusual heavy load, as the back of the vehicle almost touched the ground," Gwala said. "This appeared suspicious to the police officers, as there was only one passenger seated at the back of the vehicle."

Police officers pulled the vehicle over and questioned the men. "They noticed the back passenger was seated on top of a slaughtered cow," Gwala said. "The cow had been hacked into pieces with its head, legs and body across the back seat and its intestines hanging out. Upon questioning the men, it was alleged that they had stolen and slaughtered the cow the previous night in Ixopo," she said.
The three men were arrested for stock theft and possession of stolen property. The suspects will appear in the Umlazi Magistrates’ Court next week.
