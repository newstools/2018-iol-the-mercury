Durban - North Coast Business Women recently got together at the Hirsch’s Ballito store for their monthly women in business meeting, held in partnership with the Ilembe Chamber of Commerce and Industry, with a great turn out of ladies getting together for a great networking session. 
The guest speaker for the morning was Venusha Moodely-Nirmal the owner of 3 Little Angels Pet Nutrition and she gave an inspiring talk on how she turned her passion into a business. Moodely-Nirmal who worked for Unilever in Human food production for over 10 years decided to leave her comfortable job and take the plunge to go on her own, she has not looked back since. 3 Little Angels now has their own premises with a production kitchen that delivers food to happy animals all over KZN.

Adding to the excitement of the morning, Moodely-Nirmal was announced as the Margaret Hirsch Women in Business Achiever of the year finalist for this month. 
COE of Hirsch’s, Margaret Hirsh, started the Margaret Hirsch Women in Business Achiever of the year competition in all of the areas in which Hirsch’s operates throughout the country because she could see how she – and Hirsch’s – had benefited from the business accolades she has received over the years.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
