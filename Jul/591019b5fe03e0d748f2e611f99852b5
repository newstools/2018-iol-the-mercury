Durban - The city's Cleansing and Solid Waste (DSW) department is engaging with law enforcement officials to escort dirt collection trucks. The move comes after dirt was strewn along the N2 near uMlazi and Amanzimtoti on Monday morning, allegedly by contractors who are unhappy with conditions imposed by the municipality.
eThekwini Municipality acting head of communications, Mandla Nsele, said a disruption of services has been noted in uMlazi, KwaMakhutha, Mbumbulu, Isipingo, Folweni and Cato Manor. 
This, Nsele said, is due to a payment dispute between the main contractors and sub-contractors.
