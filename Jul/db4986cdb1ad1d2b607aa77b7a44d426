Durban - Grant van Niekerk, already facing a 10-day suspension for causing interference, picked up a further 10 days on Tuesday after an inquiry into his riding of Strathdon in the Lonsdale Stirrup Cup last month.
He is due to ride the ruling favourite African Night Sky in the R4.25million Vodacom Durban July at Greyville on Saturday.

Van Niekerk was charged that, as the rider of Strathdon, he failed to ensure that he did not cause interference to Made To Conquer over the final 300m of the race.

He pleaded not guilty but the inquiry board disagreed and slapped him with a 10-day suspension. Van Niekerk can appeal both the charge and penalty.

He is also due to leave shortly thereafter for Hong Kong, where he has been given a year’s contract to ride along with Callan Murray. The Hong Kong season starts on September 1.

After being as short as 18-10 in the ante-post market, African Night Sky appears ominously friendless and was yesterday quoted at 26-10. 

The big market mover was Matador Man, as long as 50-1 last week, Sean Tarry’s runner has firmed to 20-1, while the balance of the field have remained relatively firm.

Bookmakers are also offering odds on which horse will finish last. All at 5-1 are Gold Standard, Liege, Fiorella, Rocket Countdown and Secret Potion. African Night Sky is a 66-1 shot to finish last.
