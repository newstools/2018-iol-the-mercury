Durban - Construction of the Durban Christian Centre Jesus dome which was destroyed in a fire in June 2016, has begun. 
"Progress on the new building is beginning to show itself with new foundational work and tall scaffolding and concrete columns filling the skyline," spokesman Ron Steele said. 
The building estimated to cost around R100 million is expected to be completed in August 2019.

"Although the new church will not feature a domed roof, which made it an iconic structure in the city, it will feature three massive beams that will span the building, giving it a dome-like appearance."

The new building will seat 3000 congregants. 
In the meantime, the congregation meets in the church’s Life Centre hall that seats 1 100 people and is supplemented by using the church’s Christian school hall as an overflow venue. AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
It is believed that the illuminated cross at the top of the building had short-circuited because of several power outages that day, and the sparks had fallen into the auditorium which caused the blaze that destroyed the church.
