   "A taxi driver from the Mandini Taxi Association was shot multiple times. He was treated at the scene before being rushed to a local hospital for further care," he said. 
  
  
   
  
  
   Police spokesperson, Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane, said they could not comment on the matter as officers were still at the scene. 
  
  
   
  
  
   This shooting follows on from an ambush that claimed the lives of 12 people two weeks ago, near Ladysmith. 
  
  
   
  
  
   At the time, people affiliated to the Ivory-Park Taxi Association in Gauteng were gunned down while on their way back from a funeral in KwaZulu-Natal. 
  
  
   
  
  
   So far, one person has been arrested in connection with the shooting.
