DURBAN - A partygoer was shot to death at a party spot in uMlazi on Monday. 
The man was allegedly shot 8 times at the small establishment before the suspects fled the scene.
The incident happened just in the early hours of Monday as Durban July weekend festivities in the city were coming to a close. 
Police spokesperson, Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane, said Bonokwakhe 'Alli' Ntshangase, 24, was shot by an unknown suspect at KwaDanaza in Umlazi, a venue also known as Ka Dazz.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
Bonokwakhe "Alli" Ntshangase is believed to have been a close friend of Durban gangster Sandile “Chillies” Bhengu. 
“He sustained a shot wound on the abdomen and was taken to hospital where he succumbed to his injuries on arrival. The motive is unknown,” said Zwane.
Zwane said police were investigating a murder docket and no arrests had been made.
Ntshangase is believed to have been a close friend of Durban gangster Sandile “Chillies” Bhengu. 
Bhengu was killed by police last year when he was caught allegedly trying to remove a tracker device from an alleged stolen vehicle. His funeral saw the township come to a virtual stand still and two people were arrested at his funeral for impersonating law enforcement officials. 
Pictures of the two were shared on social media as news of his death broke on Monday.
Meanwhile, the venue where the murder took place is the subject of gqom star Babes Wodumo’s latest single “KaDazz”.  

 
The song was released in May this year by Babes Wodumo during an exclusive interview with Metro FM where she made allegations that her ex-lover Mampintsha had assaulted her. 
Mampintsha has since denied the claims.
