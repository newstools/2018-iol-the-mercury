Durban - KwaZulu-Natal transport MEC, Mxolisi Kaunda, said a provincial police task team are working with the Gauteng government to find the perpetrators behind the murder of taxi operators, who were ambushed on the R74 near Colenso on Saturday.
Eleven people were killed at the scene, when gunmen fired more than 200 rounds from automatic weapons at a taxi making its way back to Gauteng after the operators had attended the funeral of another taxi operator in Greytown. 
A twelfth person wounded in the shooting has since died.
Although Kaunda’s report did not include a police report of the incident, he said they believe the police are “hot on the heels” of those who orchestrated and acted in the ambush.

As KwaZulu-Natal, we assure this House that we will offer all assistance needed to conclude this matter” he said. 
Kaunda said they have also directed police and officials from both provinces to be on high alert and guard against those who may want to take advantage of the incident and perpetuate violence in the area. 
Kaunda said police also established that high-calibre firearms were used in the shooting.
He said the inter-provincial task team that was set up in 2014 has since expanded and will also be monitoring the situation in Gauteng, Mpumalanga, the Eastern Cape, Limpopo and the Free State. 
In KZN, notorious hotspots for taxi violence and conflict, such as Newcastle, KwaMaphumulo, Stanger, Ladysmith and Nongoma had stabilised, he said.
However, Kaunda said they did observe “simmering tensions” between metered taxi and e-hailing operators, such as Uber, Taxify and Good Fellows. 
“The Department of Transport, working with the eThekwini Municipality, is intervening in this matter and a task team has been established to look into the complaints, and create a conducive environment for both operators to coexist harmoniously,” Kaunda said.
