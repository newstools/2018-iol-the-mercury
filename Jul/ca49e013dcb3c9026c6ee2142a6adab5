You will never find garlic in the kitchen cupboards at Buckingham Palace because Queen Elizabeth banned it from use years ago.
 

 The monarch is also not too fond of anyone from the royal family using the ingredient in their kitchens.

 

 A few years ago former Buckingham Palace kitchen chef Darren McGrady confirmed the rumours: "When [the Queen] was at the table, there was no garlic at all...she was very Victorian and believed when she was brought up that you don’t eat garlic—because if you were holding an audience the next day, you didn’t want to be breathing garlic. It was seen as antisocial."

 

 This has now been confirmed by the Duchess of Cornwall, Camilla Parker Bowles who earlier this month appeared on the Australian Masterchef and was quizzed about what the royals can and can't eat. 
 “I hate to say this, but garlic. Garlic is a no-no,” Bowles say's
 .

   Gary Mehigan then asked the Dutchess if the garlic ban was because it could cause bad breath and she agreed it was the reason: 
  “Yes, exactly...so you always have to lay off the garlic.”
 

 

 In the past the Queen has admitted that she isn't much of a foodie, none the less she appears to be quite particular about the food she eats.
