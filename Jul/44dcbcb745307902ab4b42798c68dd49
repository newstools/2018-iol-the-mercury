Durban - The Dundee July 2018 raised the bar setting a new standard of excellence for this rural horse racing event. The event, which follows on after the Vodacom Durban July showcases the very best of rural horseracing in KwaZulu-Natal. 
A grand line-up of artists for the Dundee July 2018 Experience including Babes Wodumo, DJ Sox, DJ Tira, Qhoshangokwenza kwakhe Hlengiwe Mhlaba and Zakwe on the main stage had thousands of people dancing the afternoon away on the race track. Thereafter they joined the mega after party show Dundee Experience, hosted by Village Events of Vezokuhle Nala.
While VIPs and guests were hosted at the sponsor marquees, other race goers there to support the horses and jockeys from their districts enjoyed the day braaiing, picnicking or buying food from local vendors along the track, while they rooted for the competitors.
 Some of the younger spectators, who had climbed to the top of a flat-topped tree along-side the track, had a great vantage point with sight of the start and the finish of the 2km track.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
