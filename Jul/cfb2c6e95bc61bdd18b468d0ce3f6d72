Durban - A man who was out on parole for attempted robbery and committed another robbery has been jailed for 15 years. 

 

 Philani Jali, 32, pleaded guilty in the Ntuzuma Regional Court on Tuesday to robbery, illegal possession of a firearm, and illegal possession of ammunition. 

 

 In March 2013, Jali was jailed in the Durban Regional Court for the attempted robbery he committed on November 28, 2011. 

 

 He was recently released on parole. 

 

 However, Jali said on November 26, 2011, he together with his co-accused went to buy half a loaf of white bread at a tuck shop in Inanda when he decided to rob the owner, Dudu Nsele.

 In his plea, Jali said he pointed a firearm at her and robbed her of her Samsung cellphone and R250 cash. 

 

 He said he was later apprehended by members of the community and returned the cellphone to Nsele. 

 

 Jali said that at all times he knew that his actions were wrong and unlawful. 

 

 Magistrate Ela Grange jailed Jali for 10 years for robbery and five years for illegal possession of a firearm and illegal possession of two rounds of live ammunition. 

 

 Grange ordered that Jali complete his previous jail term, which would have ended in 2020 and then begin serving his 15 years sentence.
