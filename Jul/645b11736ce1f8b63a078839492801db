Durban - The ANC in KwaZulu-Natal wants the party's national executive committee (NEC) to review its stance on support for former President Jacob Zuma when he appears in court on corruption charges. 
This comes as Zuma will be appearing at the Pietermaritzburg High court later this week.
Earlier this year, the NEC took a decision that no party structures should support Zuma when he appears in court.

The NEC also said while some members can attend court proceedings as individuals, no party regalia should be worn on those occasions. Some leaders of the ANC have recently attended Zuma's court appearances where many party members defied the ANC defied the NEC directive by wearing party regalia. 
In a special resolution adopted by the conference held at the Durban University of Technology, the 2 200 delegates said the new provincial leadership will have to engage with the NEC to try and persuade it to change its stance on Zuma. 
The conference felt that the charges Zuma is facing are not new and there is no reason not to support him as the party had previously supported him.
Another special resolution adopted by the conference was on land. The delegates stated clearly that there is no intention to expropriate land under the Ingonyama Trust.
