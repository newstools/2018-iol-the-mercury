Earlier, Miguel's family confronted the father of the man who was last seen with him nearly two weeks ago pleading with him to ask his son where the boy was.
The confrontation took place outside courtroom 10 where the man was due to appear on kidnapping charges.

His father, Shah Ebrahim, who came to court with a poster in support of Miguel's family said he was devastated for the family.
"He took our child. Please speak to him and ask him to tell us where he is," Miguel's aunt, Faye Vetter pleaded. 
However, Ebrahim told her that he barely had a relationship with his son.  He claimed that his son was a violent person and has not spoken to each other in months.
