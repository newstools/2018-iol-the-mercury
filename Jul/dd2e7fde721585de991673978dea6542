Durban - Police have been deployed to Link Road in Shallcross, Chatsworth, after protests erupted in the area in the early hours of Monday morning. Residents took to the streets to burn debris and protest for better service delivery. Due to the volatile nature of the protest, the road was closed off to traffic. 

KwaZulu-Natal spokesperson, Captain Nqobile Gwala, said residents had been protesting from the night before. 

“On Sunday night, community members embarked on protest action at around 8pm. They were burning tyres and blocked off the road.  They started again this morning complaining about electricity,” she said. AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

Gwala said no property was damaged during the protests. 

“A case of public violence is being investigated by Chatsworth SAPS. No arrests were made. Police are at the scene to stabilise the situation,” Gwala said. 

Meanwhile, a few kilometres away, “land invaders” are continuing to demand space at the Silverglen Nature Reserve. For the last few weeks, police have been monitoring the situation in Silverglen. 

Now, they have given city mayor, Zandile Gumede, a week to reply to their demands. 

On Sunday they marched along a route near the Silverglen Nature Reserve before handing over a memorandum of demands to the police.

March leader Mbulelo ­Hadebe said they had expected eThekwini mayor Zandile ­Gumede to accept their memorandum, but it was instead ­accepted by police in her ­absence.

“If we don’t get a response in seven days, we will march to her office at the (Durban) City Hall,” said Hadebe.
