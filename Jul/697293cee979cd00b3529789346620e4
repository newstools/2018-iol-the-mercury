Durban - Local businessman Vivian Reddy has received an international lifetime achievement award in recognition of his social cohesion efforts, philanthropic work and strides in business.
Granted by a UK global economic development organisation at a ceremony held at the House of Commons on June 29, the prestigious award recognises outstanding people throughout the world. 

Last year’s winner of the award was Shiva Ayyadurai, the inventor of e-mail. 

Reddy said he had been involved in a number of initiatives to foster social cohesion between Indians and Africans in KwaZulu-Natal.

This started when playwright Mbongeni Ngema produced a song called Amandiya, which was later banned by the SABC as it was felt it constituted hate speech against Indians.

He has also done a lot of philanthropic work with his trust and associate businesses, donating more than R160million to charities.

“I live by what I call the principle of constant and 
never-ending improvement. I try to make every day of my life a better day by serving people better.”

Reddy said he was still concerned about racial tensions which seemed to be flaring up again, but promised that he would again act on this. 

He said racial tension was among the issues he was asked about during his international travels. 

“I am doing this as a patriotic South African who believes that all races should live in harmony and cohesion. 

“When you remove racial tensions it makes it more conducive for business and for investors to come in,” he said.
