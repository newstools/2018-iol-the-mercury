Durban - A 28-year-old Pietermaritzburg man’s need for speed was brought to an abrupt halt when he was nabbed riding a Honda motorcyle more than double the speed limit, on the N3 on Monday. 

Transport spokesperson Mluleki Mntungwa said the man whizzed past Road Traffic Inspectorate (RTI) officers who were manning a speed trap on the N3 near Camperdown at 275km/hour. AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

He put pedal to the metal, trying to outdrive the officers who caught up with him 15km later.

On behalf of MEC Mxolisi Kaunda, Mtungwa condemned reckless behaviour saying it not only potentially endangered his own life but that of other road users. 

“MEC Kaunda would also like to commend the officers for apprehending him to face the full might of the law for his behaviour.”
