Durban - In just a few weeks time, Bellair SAPS will host their first official Crime Awareness Day. On August 18, the Hillary Primary School grounds will play host to the station's event which seeks to unite the community and police. 
 

 Speaking ahead of the Crime Awareness Day, Bellair SAPS station commander, Lieutenant Colonel Rajan Ramchunder, said after months of planning they are looking forward to hosting the community and answering their questions. 

 

 "This initiative is being put together by our officers, along with the Community Policing Forum and we are hoping to engage with residents on their level. We have invited other police units to come in and stage displays for the community.  We want to initiate a communication between us as police and residents. We believe by doing this, we will form a long lasting working relationship for both parties," he said.
