Local entertainer Zodwa Wabantu is making use of all those bags she's securing with her buying property in Mpumalanga for business purposes. 
Posting on her Instagram page, Wabantu tagged EFF leader Julius Malema when shared a video of her newly acquired property in Mpumalanga, alongside the caption: "I have the Land @julius.malema.sello Izimbungulu azina Nex zilala emzini wenye indoda. my Second Land Ngakhile futhi. You can disrespect me kodwa Angizalwa e South Beach. I have Flats there wena unani making fun of me", which loosely translates to "I have the land, so the bed bugs can go to another man's house".

Speaking to Drum Magazine, Wabantu said that the land she bought in the Ehlanzeni District is purely for business purposes. 
“I have already bought land that I will live on. This land is for pushing my business, I’ll see whether I open a shisanyama, theatre or a cinema. I’ll see what I’ll do on the land, maybe I could even open a supermarket."
The vosho queen explained that she bought the property in South Beach, Durban as means to make extra income. 
“I opened the flats and rented them out to students as a student accommodation. This creates profit for me."
“For example, if I get to Durban and I get a two bedroom apartment, I will lease it for R4200 and get nine students who’ll pay R1000 each to stay in the apartment. From that R9000, I’ll pay the R4200 for the lease and get the rest of the money as profit,” she said.
