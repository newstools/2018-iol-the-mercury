Durban - Police arrested an alleged illegal hunter found in possession of dead animals in his vehicle at a farm outside Tzaneen in Limpopo this week.
Police spokesperson Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said security guards at the farm had followed up on information about poachers roaming the area.
“During that process, they spotted a suspicious vehicle. They approached it but six suspects got out and fled to nearby bush, leaving the driver behind. He drove away, and a car chase ensued until the driver was arrested. 
“The Mazda was searched and animal carcasses were found hidden inside.’’
Police found the carcasses of six impala, a kudu, an ostrich and three nyala in the bakkie. The driver is expected to appear in the Tzaneen Magistrate’s Court soon on charges of illegal hunting.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
