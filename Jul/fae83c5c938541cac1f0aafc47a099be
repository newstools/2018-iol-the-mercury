Durban - For the first time in 18 years, the South African PowerBall jackpot for tomorrow is sitting at an estimated R110million.
According to the operator of the national lottery, Ithuba, this is a milestone for them and for the South African lottery industry as a whole.
“It is no secret that a jackpot of this magnitude attracts a lot of players. This means that, as the national lottery operator, our weekly 27% contribution towards supporting charity causes increases. 
“This is money that is going towards helping support essential needs of disadvantaged South Africans. 
“It has always been Ithuba’s intention to contribute positively and actively to socio-economic development,” said Khensani Mabuza, member of the Ithuba executive team. 
In January, Lotto reached a guaranteed jackpot of R110m. This groundbreaking jackpot was won by four people and one of the winners was a first-time Lotto player. 
“All winners receive extensive financial advice and, in addition, trauma counselling from qualified psychologists to help them deal with the new financial changing circumstances. Both these services are at no cost to the winner,” said Ithuba.
