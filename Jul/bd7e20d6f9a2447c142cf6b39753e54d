She said the incident happened around 1pm on Friday afternoon.
“They came with the other males and accosted the three victims that were inside the house. They produced firearms and took two computers, cellphones, a  TV set and takkies before fleeing the scene in their getaway white Toyota Etios,” said Gwala.
Meanwhile, residents have been warned to be vigilant by local security company Blue Security.
Blue spokesperson Andreas Mathios said the panic alarm button activated was activated when the students were accosted on Friday. 
“A gang of five robbers, two of them armed with firearms,  arrived at the residential premises in a white Toyota Etios, where they held up students who live in the residence. They robbed the students of their cellphones, a television, a decoder, a watch and two bottles of alcohol,” Mathios said.
