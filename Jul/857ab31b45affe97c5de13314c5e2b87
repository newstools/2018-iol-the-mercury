King Shaka International Airport(KSIA) received a four-star ranking for on-time performance in the latest assessment by OAG, a global provider of flight information.

The OTP Star Ratings are measured across a rolling 12-month period. 

To achieve an OTP star rating, the world’s airlines and airports must meet two simple criteria: all airlines and airports must have a minimum of 600 operations a month and OAG must receive flight status information for no less than 80 percent of scheduled flights within the 12-month period.

King Shaka International Airport  - 84.8%

O. R. Tambo International Airport  - 82.9% on-time performance

Cape Town International Airport -  84.4% 


Azwifaneli "Fani" Mphaphuli, AGM of Client and Passenger Services explains what the four-star rating means.

“Aircrafts taking off and landing are ensuring that they are strictly keeping to the scheduled times and this is allowing the passengers to be on time and certainly on maintaining the loyalty to that airline. It also means that scheduled airline aircrafts are departing and arriving on scheduled time as per IATA set target of 15 minutes,” said Mphaphuli.

Mphaphuli said because KSIA is close to an hour’s journey from most destinations in South Africa, the flying community can plan and arrive at destinations with no delays.
