Durban - MEC for Economic Development, Tourism and Environmental Affairs, Sihle Zikalala, is due to lead an inter-father prayer service in uMkhanyakude, northern KwaZulu-Natal,  this week in light of the number of attacks on people with albinism in recent months.

Zikalala is due to lead the service in his capacity as the uMkhanyakude District Champion. 

In a press statement, the department said the prayer will also cover the number of political killings that have plagued the province.

“The uMkhanyakude District prayer is part of the provincial government prayer programme aimed at galvanising various sectors of the society to fight against the social ills, including political killings,” the statement said. AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
