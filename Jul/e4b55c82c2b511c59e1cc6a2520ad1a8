Durban - With the sardine run in full swing, it was a bumper weekend for netters.
Tony Outar netted 500 crates at Winklespruit on Saturday, making it his biggest catch for this year’s sardine run so far. 

After spotting the sardines, he sailed less than 500m off the main beach at about 7.30am to net the fish which he has since sold to the public, fishmongers and restaurants. AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

“There were quite a lot of fish and a lot of competition, so I started off selling them at R500 a crate, then went down to R200,” he said. 

Outar was not so lucky on Sunday, however. 

He went to several beaches, and although he spotted sardines again at Pennington Beach they were too far off shore, so he called it a day without a catch. 

He said one netter had tried to cross the Illovo River mouth in a 4x4 on Saturday, but got stuck in the water, leaving the vehicle half submerged. 

The sardine frenzy is ­expected to continue as reports of sardine pockets scattered on South Coast beaches continue to pour in. 

Greg Thompson, the operations manager at the KZN Sharks Board, said sardines had been spotted between Warner Beach and Hibberdene. 

“It seems like most of these pockets were thin and not concentrated in any specific area. The conditions are nice and settled behind the backline, but the surf zone is strong.”

He said the shark nets had been removed from all protected beaches, from Anstey’s on the Bluff to Port Edward on the South Coast. 

“Most of the netting has been replaced along the Durban beachfront as the sardine movement seems to be bypassing this area for now. 

“The only beaches still closed in Durban are Laguna, eThekwini and Country Club,” said Thompson.
