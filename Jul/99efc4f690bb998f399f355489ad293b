Durban - Acting South African Revenue Service commissioner Mark Kingon said being at the service of taxpayers is one of Sars objectives this tax season.

Sars launched its Service Charter - which outlines taxpayers’ rights and responsibilities as well as service standards they can expect from the agency -  this month coinciding with the start of tax season 2018.

Kingon said the Service Charter followed a series of engagement with tax practitioner bodies as well as the Tax Ombud and other key stakeholders
