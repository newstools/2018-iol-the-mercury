Durban - A young jazz composer from Queensburgh stands a chance to win a R200 000 scholarship as he is one of two finalists in the jazz category for the prestigious annual Southern African Music Rights Organisation (Samra) Overseas Scholarships for Composers Competition.
Riley Giandhari, along with four other young composers, will see their works performed by some of South Africa’s best musicians at a concert on August 18 at the Linder Auditorium in Johannesburg, where the winner will be announced.
The 23-year-old said music had always been his passion and he drew inspiration from his father, who plays multiple instruments, at a young age.
“As a little boy, the highlight of my week was watching my dad play in the praise and worship team at church on a Sunday. He was my first influence as a musician. Ever since, I have wanted to learn as much as I could.” he said.
Influenced by various genres, Giandhari said he enjoyed listening and playing different styles of music, including jazz, funk, house, afrobeat, Latin jazz, rap and gospel music. “My music is a reflection of this.” AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
Currently completing his master’s in composition at the University of Kwa- Zulu-Natal, Giandhari said his inspiration for music came through observation.
“I live and breathe music. I am constantly aware of different sounds in my environment and this helps in the composition of my music.”
The part-time Kearsney College music teacher said he entered the competition because he was looking for new challenges and ways to advance his skills.
“If I win I would like to develop my profession as a composer and performer overseas,” he said. 
The other finalists are Ndabuzekwayo Perfect Bombo, Lise Morrison, Conrad Asman and Andrew Hoole.
