DURBAN - Thabisile Ncayiyane, 36, the woman known as the “mayor’s helper”, has posted her CV on Facebook.
She has also denied ever being a domestic worker.

Ncayiyane’s appointment is at the centre of two investigations by two units within the eThekwini Municipality.

According to one investigator, he visited the community in which Ncayiyane lived and questioned those who knew her. He claimed that he met with her subsequently and she had told him that she was a former domestic worker. He said Ncayiyane was unable to provide her qualifications.

Ncayiyane said she was not employed in the mayor’s office.

She said she had a national diploma in public management from the Mangosuthu University of Technology (MUT), a Bachelor’s degree in public management, from the Durban University of Technology (DUT), a post-graduate diploma in project management with Mancosa, and a BA in international relations from Unisa, among other certificates.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

Regarding her work history, she said she had worked at the Black Management Forum, the Department of Economic Development and Tourism, the Department of International Relations and Co-operation, the Electoral Commission, the Department of Education and Transnet.

MUT confirmed she had obtained a diploma from the institution, and the Black Management Forum confirmed she had worked there as an intern.

Mancosa could not divulge her information as she had not given the private university permission to do so.

The Department of International Relations and Co-operation would not confirm if she was an employee for “security reasons”. Unisa and DUT had not responded by the time of publication.

Ncayiyane said: “I know the concerted malicious efforts that are done in my name targeting the mayor of the eThekwini Municipality. This is done by certain officials within the municipality and they are known.”
