DURBAN - As the biggest party of the year gets underway today authorities have warned people across the city not to let their guard down because criminals could be eyeing the wads of cash being carried around.SAPS KZN spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala urged people not to leave their valuables unattended.“All those who will be attending the Durban July must make sure they don’t leave their bags or belongings unattended. Should anything suspicious happen, people must inform the police or security officers. “We are also warning people not to carry large sums of cash. They must consider safe options like using cards to pay,” said Gwala.SA Banking Risk Information Centre (Sabric) chief executive Kalyani Pillay said: “Criminals are always looking for opportunities to defraud their victims, particularly at this time of year when they know that people are winding  down during the holidays, and are spending money on leisure acti vities. “Sabric urges customers to be aware of the latest crime trends so they do not become victims.” Two crime types remained prevalent, she said: where victims were followed out of a bank branch after making a cash withdrawal, or where victims were followed after withdrawing money at an ATM. TransactPillay said people should try to find safer ways to transact, rather than carrying cash, and be alert to their surroundings.Dave MacLeod of Gameplan Media, who handle the media and publicity for the Vodacom Durban July, urged people to carry bags large enough to hold their valuables and not to leave things such as cellphones at hospitality venues when walking about.Apart from ensuring people do not become targets, authorities have warned against driving under the influence of alcohol.Gwala said: “A number of operations will be conducted and people are warned not to drink and drive. We advise people to be cautious at all times.”“Big Brother”, in the form of metro police officers, along with technology, will also be watching over the July festivities and  more than 50 other parties and events scheduled to take place this weekend. About 55 000 people are expected to attend the July alone.“The whole racecourse precinct, inner and outer perimeters, will be monitored by close circuit television cameras,” said metrospokesperson senior superintendent Parboo Sewpersad.“This extends to all the major highways and motorways in and around greater Durban. The various metro police unit personnel, foot, motorised, and multi-operational response team will be deployed in numbers, and work in conjunction with their SAPS colleagues, including the police  helicopter on rapid response stand-by. “This is to ensure the safety and security of the racegoers and the public at large.”Sewpersadh said a strong police presence would continue across eThekwini because of the various after-parties and events which have been planned.“Various roadblocks and stop and searches will be conducted throughout the weekend, to test for drunken driving, and the searching of suspicious vehicles for any illegal activities.”He cautioned people to not park illegally to avoid having their vehicles towed away, to not leave valuables in cars, to obey all police instructions and heed all road closures and diversions.Sewpersad said past events had shown that people arrived late and therefore parked inappropriately, obstructing traffic.“We have to tow these vehicles away,” he said, adding that only on presentation of the vehicle’s papers and log book, as well as the owner’s identity documents, would a vehicle be released.“They will also have to pay for the towing, which comes to around R750.”Drunk drivers are routinely locked up until they are sober, after which they may contact their attorneys to arrange for immediate bail followed by a court appearance on Monday.He said that as from 6am Saturday, DLI Avenue, the main road that cuts across the Greyville Racecourse, between Gladys Manzi (Mitchell) and Avondale roads, would become a one-way, with all traffic being made to travel in a westerly direction towards Avondale Road.Avondale Road, southbound, would be used as a drop-off zone only, for the general public and  for taxis.Public parking is pre-sold at R175 per vehicle, and is located on the golf course inside the racetrack, and on the north and south sides of DLI Avenue. This parking lot can accommodate about 5 000 vehicles.“Physically challenged persons and emergency vehicles will park directly in front of the Main Gate on the centre island in Avondale Road,” he said.THE INDEPENDENT ON SATURDAY
