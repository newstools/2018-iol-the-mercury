Durban - A crowd gathered outside the Verulam Magistrate's Court where a man accused of raping his 10-year-old step-daughter was due to appear. 

On Monday morning, the crowd gathered at the court carrying placards and chanting anti-child abuse slogans. AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

They are demanding that the man's bail application be denied. 

 



The 43-year-old accused, who cannot be named to protect the identity of the minor, was arrested last month. During his arrest, the man was allegedly assaulted by angry community members.

Ward councillor Johnson Chetty said the man and child had lived in his ward for about six months after relocating from Johannesburg.

He said community members had raised the alarm about the alleged abuse.

They called the local security company, Reaction Unit SA, to help rescue the child and apprehend the man.

“The community realised the child was being held captive. Instead of having an ‘its not my business’ attitude, they were proactive. We understand that the mother passed away some years ago and the stepfather has allegedly been raping the child for five years.”

Chetty said sex toys were found in the house, which was in absolute squalor.

“It was not fit for human habitation, let alone a child,” said Chetty.
