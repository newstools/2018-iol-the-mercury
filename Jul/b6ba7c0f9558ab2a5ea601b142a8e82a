Durban - A bronze bust of King Goodwill Zwelithini and that of Nelson Mandela will soon grace Mitchell Park in Morningside.
This is after the city’s executive committee gave the Sivananda World Peace and Community Development Foundation approval to erect a monument, including these busts, at the park.

The foundation will be responsible for the erection of the busts and will bear all the costs, with the city only providing supervision.

According to documents presented at exco, the project is aimed at commemorating 45 years since the coronation of King Zwelithini, who is the longest serving monarch of the Zulus.

Founder of the Sivananda Foundation, Ishwar Ramlutchman - who enjoys a close relationship with the king - said the busts will be unveiled in September but he would not divulge the costs for the project.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads

He said the project was meant to highlight the province’s rich and diverse heritage, and will thus feature a plaque on the history of the coloureds, Zulus and Indians.

There will also be another plaque detailing the king’s history while a Sivananda Peace Pillar will also be erected.

“This monument will serve as a symbol of reconciliation, tolerance and will also highlight the heritage of the pioneers, the courage and commitment of the freedom fighters, the wisdom, passion and determination of the visionaries of a non-racial and a democratic South Africa,” Ramlutchman said in a letter to council.

Meanwhile, King Zwelithini will celebrate his 70th birthday, at his eNyokeni palace on Friday. 

High ranking politicians and other dignitaries are expected to attend the bash. 

Last year, at his birthday bash festivities, the 
king said he wanted this year’s celebrations to be even bigger.
