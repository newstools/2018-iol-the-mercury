On Thursday morning, some municipal workers, on the site, were still continuing with preparations and were setting up in the second marquee which was not affected.
While the motive was unknown there was already speculation that this could be linked to the ongoing protests in uMlazi by refuse removal contractors who are aggrieved for not being paid by the municipality.
Some of the contractors had, earlier this week, threatened to step up their protests.

The Mercury has sent questions to the municipality to try and establish whether this event will continue or not.
The business fair was expected to attract about 84 exhibitors (mainly emerging businesses) and over 16 000 buyers, potential investors and partners.In an earlier press release the municipality said the business fair "will not only showcase locally manufactured products, but will also empower aspiring entrepreneurs through several new developmental features to be hosted".
