Two days earlier, two devices were detonated, causing a fire at the Woolworths store in Gateway, as well as at the chain’s Pavilion branch.

There was another scare at The Pavilion this week when a member of the public spotted a “device” in the parking lot. This was later found to be a false alarm as the “device” was merely a discarded security tag. An explosive device was also reportedly exploded at a Spar in Wentworth on Monday.

Two explosive devices were discovered in Morningside near the Greyville Racecourse, where thousands of people had gathered for the Vodacom Durban July on Saturday.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
