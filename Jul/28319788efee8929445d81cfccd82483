Durban - About 500 people are allowed to “stroll” in and out of the country daily in front of members of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) at the border between South Africa and Swaziland without any checks.
That is the allegation made by the DA leaders following a visit to the border this week.
DA's Deputy Shadow Minister of Police, Dianne Kohler Barnard MP and DA Shadow Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Annette Steyn and Zululand East Constituency Head Hlanganani Gumbi visited the area on Monday.
“We knew that the situation at the borders was quite bad, but I was still shocked by what I saw there,” said Barnard.
SANDF spokesperson  Brig-General  Mafi Mgobhozi said: “Our challenge as the defence force is the issue of the fence, there is none there. Even the arrests we make tend to be futile because we arrest someone today, two or three days later you see them crossing back home again.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
