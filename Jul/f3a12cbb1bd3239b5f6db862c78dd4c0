Durban - The man accused of murdering a 7-year-old girl is due back in court next week for his bail application. On Tuesday morning, a large crowd of angry residents made their way to the Verulam Magistrates Court where the man was due to appear. Due to the large crowd and security fears, the matter was moved to the family court.
