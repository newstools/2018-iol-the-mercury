Durban - Doing humanitarian work for the community that will lead to the greater good of South Africa is one of the pillars of the Chatsworth Rotary Club.
This is according to past president Vani Govender, who said programmes that they undertake as a club are aligned with the needs of the community.
“We recently put up a container which is used as a crèche in the community. Our outreach programmes range from poverty alleviation, handing out of school uniforms as well as the improvement of water and sanitation.”
Govender explained that the Rotary Club is part of an international collective made up of over 33000 clubs all over the world.
She said the Chatsworth Rotary Club is one of 90 in South Africa.
Govender said the Chatsworth Rotary club, which has 27 Rotarians, recently celebrated 30 years in existence, and having not taken part in the Gold Cup fund-raiser last year, members’ preparations for year’s marquee were going well.AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
“We have 20 tables in our marquee and ticket sales have gone very well,” she said.
She said sponsors last year contacted them asking about their participation in the fund-raiser, adding that this year there has been a high demand for tickets.
“It brings an exciting day for everyone, a day for art, food and fellowship, and knowing that the money raised goes to a good cause makes it even more worth it.”
Govender says their members come from all walks of life and professions and they all work together for the greater good of the community.
“We do anything at grassroots level that will help the community, but our work depends largely on fund-raisers, and the Golf Cup is one of our signature fund-raisers”.
