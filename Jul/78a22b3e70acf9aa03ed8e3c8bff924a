Pietermaritzburg - A march in support of former president Jacob Zuma, who is appearing in court this morning on charges of fraud and corruption related to the multi-billion rand arms deal, started at around 8 am from Dales Park to the Pietermaritzburg High Court.
  

 

 Spirits were high and security was tight as people gathered from before 7 am outside the court in support of Zuma.

 

 MK military veterans and supporters of the former president are in a buoyant mood, with many reiterating their belief that 'Msholozi' is being politically persecuted.

 

 A number of police units stood guard in the vicinity of the Pietermaritzburg High Court to maintain order among the crowd and allow people on their way to work to move with ease.


 
 


 

 Sniffer dogs cleared the high court of any possible danger while media houses gathered outside in numbers awaiting Zuma's arrival.
