Durban - The 43-year-old man accused of kidnapping a Sydenham youngster has claimed that he played no part in the child’s disappearance. 
On Monday, the man made his second appearance in the Durban Magistrate’s Court. 
Initially charged with kidnapping, he now faces a charge of human trafficking and the investigation has been handed over to the Durban Organised Crime Unit. 
Due to the nature of the charge, magistrate Mohamed Motala ordered the media not to publish the accused’s picture or his name.

In court, Raylene Louw and her mother, Arlene Dunn, who were seated in the public gallery, could not hold back their anger or emotions. 
“Tell me where is my son? Where is my son, you psycho,” a distraught Louw shouted at the accused, who just stared ahead of him. 
She was ordered by the clerk of the court to restrain herself. 

Earlier, Miguel’s aunt, Faye Vetter, was heard speaking to the accused’s father. 
“We just want to know where our boy is. He took our son,” she said. 
The accused’s father told the family that he did not know anything about the kidnapping or the events leading up to it. 
Cutting a lonely figure, the accused listened to Motala. As he walked out of the dock, he mumbled: “I did not do this.”AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
