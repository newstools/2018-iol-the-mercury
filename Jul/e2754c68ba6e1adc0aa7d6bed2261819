Durban - Grant beneficiaries will get much needed reprieve from unauthorised debits as their new cards will not allow for deductions of their money.
This week, the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) briefed stakeholders, at the Msunduzi Municipality, on changes brought by the new cards being issued.
The changes are part of the migration to the new South African Post Office (Sapo) distribution system.
Sassa communications manager in KwaZulu-Natal Mbizeni Mdlalose said one of the key changes brought with the new card was that it had been “locked”.

“We encourage people, who live close to the city, to make use of the post office when they are drawing their money,” he said. 
Mdlalose said people using private bank accounts should be aware that it is not necessary to change the card. Those who wish to start accessing their grants through private bank accounts can visit Sassa offices close to them to fill out forms. 
“We engaged our stakeholders like councillors (yesterday) to inform them about the changes, as we will also be making announcements about where people can come to change their cards.”
He said people can change their cards at the post office and the Sassa offices. 

“We have set the deadline of August 21 to change all cards.”
