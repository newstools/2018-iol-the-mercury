Durban - Tributes poured in after the sudden death of former president Jacob Zuma’s son, Vusi Nhlakanipho Zuma, was confirmed on Monday morning.
Nhlakanipho Zuma was 25 years old and the youngest of five siblings born to his late mother, Kate Mantsho.

ANC spokesperson Pule Mabe said the organisation shared the family’s grief and was deeply saddened by the untimely death of Vusi Zuma.

“A bright and promising young lion and disciplined member of the ANC, Nhlakanipho Zuma was a dedicated and humble activist, who took a keen interest in the livelihood of our people. 

:”His acts of kindness and gentle soul will forever remain in our hearts,” Mabe said, on behalf of the ­organisation. 

The ANC conveyed its condolences to the Zuma family and his close friends. 

According to close friend of the family and MK veteran Carl Niehaus, Vusi died at Milpark Hospital in Joburg on Sunday night, after suffering a short illness.

Zelda la Grange the former aide of Nelson Mandela expressed devastation at the news of Vusi Zuma’s death describing him as a “beautiful child”. 

“Oh my word. This is terrible. Vusi was a beautiful child. We saw him grow up,” La Grange tweeted adding that he had crossed her mind just a few days earlier.

According to La Grange, Vusi Zuma had attended the Sacred Heart College in Joburg.

Vusi Zuma stayed out of the spotlight and not much was known about him. 

He was 8 years old when his mother, Mantsho, killed herself by taking an overdose of sleeping and Malaria pills. 

By late yesterday afternoon, the family had still not appointed a family spokesperson and were believed to have been locked in a family meeting for most of the day in Joburg. 

President Cyril Ramaphosa also sent his condolences to the family. 

“Our thoughts and prayers are with the Zuma family at this time, and we wish the Lord gives former president Zuma strength. 

“May his son’s soul rest in eternal peace,” Ramaphosa said.
