Durban - In a protest calling for the ousting of ward councilor Spha Madlala, Copesville residents blocked roads and marched on Wednesday morning in Pietermaritzburg.

The community accused Madlala of poor performance and alleged that he failed to address critical issues on housing and development in the area.

The residents started protesting in the early hours of Wednesday morning, blocking the main road that connects the Copesville suburbs - home to thousands people -  to other areas including the city centre. AdChoicesADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
Police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane said the march had started about 4 am on Wednesday morning.  
Public transport came to a standstill and those heading to work were left stranded. 

“The community is quite upset with the councilor and the municipality leadership. We have written to the Mayor Themba Njilo and the Speaker Jabu Ngubo and there has been no answers,” said a community member Thami Mbeje.
