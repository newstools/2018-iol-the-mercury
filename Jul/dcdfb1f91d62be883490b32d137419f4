Durban - The 43-year-old man charged with multiple counts of rape in relation to his step daughter has been denied bail in the Verulam Magistrate's Court on Friday.

Magistrate Irfaan KhalilÂ made his ruling with chants of "no bail, rot in jail" ringing from outside the court as concerned community members picketed.

"The man has already issued threats while in custody and I think if released he is likely to harm the child, should he find where she is," said Khalil.

He said the release of the accused was also likely to cause outrage in the community.

Khalil also took into consideration a petitioned signed by 129 community members calling for no bail.

He says incidents of child rape were highly prevalent which is a growing concern.

"His release will undermine public order and security. I therefore find that it is not in the interest of justice to release the applicant," he said.

The matter was adjourned to 23 August for further investigation.

It came out in court that investigations were likely to be complete in 2- 3 months.
