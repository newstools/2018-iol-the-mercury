Durban - Former president Jacob Zuma’s son, Vusi Nhlakanipho Zuma died from complications of systemic lupus erythematosus, known as lupus, said family spokesperson Linda Makatini.
Lupus is a systemic autoimmune disease that occurs when the body’s immune system attacks its own tissue and organs. Vusi, 25, was born to Zuma’s late wife Kate Mantsho. He was the youngest of five children. 

Makatini said an intimate memorial service, between close family and friends, for the young Zuma would be held on Thursday. 

The funeral service would then take place on Saturday at 9am, at the Rhema Recreational Centre in Randburg, after which he will be buried at West Park Cemetery.

Makatini said the family were gathering daily for prayer. 

“We continue to gather together for support and prayers between 6pm and 7pm at home in Forest Town,” she said.

The Zuma family also conveyed their gratitude for the messages of condolences and support since the news of ­Vusi’s death on Sunday night. 

“The Zuma family would like to express its heartfelt gratitude for the warm messages of support extended to it by the nation,”  they said.

Others who sent tributes and messages to the family, included former public protector Thuli Madonsela, EFF leader Julius Malema and former aide of Nelson Mandela, Zelda la Grange.
