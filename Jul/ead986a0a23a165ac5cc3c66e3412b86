DURBAN - President Cyril Ramaphosa was a no show at his #ThumaMina launch in Chatsworth.The highly anticipated event, announced at the start of the week, saw hundreds of residents from the south Durban suburb converge at the Nelson Mandela Youth Centre on a cold Friday evening.But the president did not show up as he was still in Empangeni.

 

The Chatsworth meeting was set to start at 6pm, and by 5:30 pm the Hall was full, with many people donning ANC regalia and singing. It was an ANC event under the theme, #ThumaMina (Send Me).

 

Businessmen Roy Moodley and Vivien Reddy were seated at the front of the hall, as was Ela Gandhi.But by 7pm the crowd was getting bored of the live music being played for them.That’s when ANC national executive member, Edna Molewa asked the crowd if they wanted to adjourn.She said the president was still in Empangeni after a long day of meetings and while he would still come to Chatsworth, he would also have to attend an urgent meeting on the way.

 

Later, Ravi Pillay, said the urgent meeting was extremely important, and after consulting with a disgruntled crowd the meeting was adjourned.
